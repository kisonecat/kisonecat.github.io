Midterm results
The average score on the ﬁnal exam was 1418/1800, or 78%, with a standard deviation of 230. The median score on the ﬁnal exam was 1420/1800, which is close to the mean which suggests a reasonable distribution. the distribution is posted on the website. let me please remind you that neither your worth as a human being nor as a mathematician is connected to your performance on exams. in fact, it is the opposite. you ought not take your successes too seriously nor your failures too devastatingly. for, this too shall pass. how can we make someone dissatisifed with their work, yet always satisﬁed with working? A joy it will be one day, perhaps, to remember even this. Sic transit gloria mundi.
