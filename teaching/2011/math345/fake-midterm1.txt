1. Do not write your name above. 2. Calculators are forbidden (and useless, anyhow). 3. Look inside the exam before you are instructed to do so. 4. Give yourself have 48 minutes for ﬁve problems on this fake exam. 5. Justify your answers. 6. Show your work. 7. Write your answers down. 8. Answer all questions. 9. To prevent ﬁre, do not divide by zero.
