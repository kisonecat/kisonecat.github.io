\section*{prime divisors}

Each natural number greater than or equal to 2 either is a product of
prime numbers or is itself a prime number.

Cor: Each integer, except 1 and $âˆ’1$, is divisible by some prime number.

Let p be a prime number. Then for all integers $x$ and $y$, if $p$ divides $xy$, then $p$ divides $x$ or $p$ divides $y$.
