Problem 1
State the binomial theorem, and then apply it to prove that, for nonnegative integers n,
n

/360
n k = 2n .

k=0

Be sure to explain your argument carefully.

Solution
First, I state the binomial theorem: For x, y ∈ R and a nonnegative integer n,
n

(x + y) =
k=0

n

n n−k k x y . k

Claim.

n

k=0

n k

= 2n .

Proof. Let x = y = 1; then the binomial theorem gives
n

(1 + 1)n =
k=0

n n−k k 1 1 . k

But 1k = 1 and 1n−k = 1, so
n

2n = (1 + 1)n =
k=0

n , k

which is what we wanted to prove.

Commentary
Some people gave an inductive proof of this fact; this is not needed. All you need to do is apply the binommial theorem.

Problem 2

/360

Prove, by complete induction, that every integer x ≥ 2 is either prime, or is the product of primes.

Solution
Let P (x) be the statement that x is either prime, or a product of primes. In other words, P (x) is the statement that x = p1 · · · pn for primes pi . Claim. For all integers x ≥ 2, the statement P (x) is true. Proof. We proceed by induction. Base case. Let x = 2. Then two is prime, so P (2) is true. Inductive step. We assume P (k) holds for 2 ≤ k ≤ x. We want to show P (x + 1). If x + 1 is prime, then P (x + 1) is true. If x + 1 is not prime, then x + 1 = ab for a, b ∈ N with a = 1 and b = 1. Then 2 ≤ a < x + 1 and 2 ≤ b < x + 1, so P (a) and P (b) are true. This means a = p1 . . . pn and b = q1 · · · qm for primes pi and qj , so x + 1 = ab = (p1 . . . pn )(q1 · · · qm ) so P (x + 1) is true. Thus, by strong induction, the statement P (x) holds for all integers x ≥ 2.

Commentary
Some people did not use complete induction—you really need to use complete induction here.

Problem 3
Prove that there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.

/360

Solution
Claim. There are inﬁnitely primes numbers. Proof. Suppose not—then there are ﬁnitely many prime numbers, say p1 , . . . , pn . Consider x = p1 · · · pn + 1. By the previous problem, x can be written as a product of primes, so in particular, there is a prime number pi which divides x. But pi also divides the product of all the primes, p1 · · · pn . Therefore, by the theorem that an integer dividing a and b divides a − b, we conclude that pi divides x − p1 · · · pn . But then pi divides 1, but pi > 0, so pi ≤ 1. This implies pi = 1, which is a contradiction.

Commentary
Many people gave very nicely written solutions for this problem.

Problem 4
Let A = {k ∈ Z | k ≥ 3}. Prove by induction for each n ∈ A that n 3 = n (n − 1) (n − 2) . 6 n(n − 1) . 2

/360

You may use the recurrence relation for binomial coeﬃcients, and the fact that n 2 =

You will get more points if you do the algebra in the induction eﬃciently than if you do it correctly but ineﬃciently—don’t just expand everything in sight. Look for a way to apply the distributive law to make your work easier to understand.

Solution
Let P (n) be the statement that n n (n − 1) (n − 2) . = 6 3 I claim, for an integer n with n ≥ 3, the statement P (n) holds. Proof. We proceed by induction. Base case. Consider n = 3. The statement P (3) is 3 3 = 3 (3 − 1) (3 − 2) = 1, 6

which is true by inspecting Pascal’s triangle. Inductive step. Assume P (n); we will show P (n + 1). By the recurrence relation for binomial coeﬃcients, n+1 3 n n + 3 2 n n(n − 1) = + 3 2 n (n − 1) (n − 2) n(n − 1) = + 6 2 n+1 n−2 1 = (n)(n − 1) + = (n)(n − 1) 6 2 6 =

(as we are told we may assume) (by the inductive hypothesis) (by the distributive law)

which is the statement P (n + 1). Therefore, by induction, P (n) holds for all n ≥ 3.

Commentary
Many people used the fact that n n! = k k! (n − k)! to prove this; however, the problem requires that you do this by induction.

Problem 5
Give a proof by induction that, for all n ∈ N, n2 (n + 1)2 . k = 4 k=1
3 n

/360

Then, explain why 13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + (210 )3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Solution
Let P (n) be the statement that
n

k3 =
k=1

n2 (n + 1)2 . 4

I claim P (n) holds for all n ∈ N. Proof. We proceed by induction. Base case. Let n = 1. Then P (1) asserts
1

k3 =
k=1

12 (1 + 1)2 = 1, 4

which is true. Inductive step. Suppose P (n); we prove P (n + 1). Since P (n), we know
n

k3 =
k=1

n2 (n + 1)2 . 4

Adding (n + 1)3 to both sides yields
n+1

k3 =
k=1

n2 (n + 1)2 + (n + 1)3 4 n2 + (n + 1) 4 n2 4n + 4 + 4 4 2 n + 4n + 4 4 (n + 2)2 , 4

= (n + 1)2 = (n + 1)2 = (n + 1)2 = (n + 1)2

which is the statement P (n + 1), so, by induction, we may conclude ∀n ∈ N P (n).

Claim. 13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + (210 )3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) Proof. By the preceeding claim, 13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + (210 )3 = (210 )2 (210 + 1)2 , and 4

(210 )2 (210 + 1)2 220 (220 + 2 · 210 + 1) = 4 4 = 218 (220 + 2 · 210 + 1) = 49 (410 + 2 · 45 + 1) ≡ 19 (110 + 2 · 15 + 1) (mod 3) ≡ 1(1 + 2 + 1) (mod 3) ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3)
