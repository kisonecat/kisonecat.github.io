\section*{the principle of math induction}

as an axiom schema: let $P(n)$ be a statement about a natural number $n$.  If $P(1)$ and whenever $P(n)$ then $P(n+1)$ is true, then $P(n)$ for all $n$.

\section*{examples}

sum of first $n$ odd numbers

sum of the first $n$ numbers

sum of the first $n$ squares

$n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by 3.

number of ways of covering an $n \times 2$ board with dominoes
