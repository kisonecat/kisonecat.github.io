\maketitle

\noindent This sheet summarizes what sort of content will appear on
the midterm.  \textbf{Calculators are not permitted} and would be
useless anyhow.

\section*{Possible topics}

The first midterm may include material through lecture 12
(``divisibility'').  In particular, congruences $a \equiv b \pmod c$
and prime numbers will \textbf{not} appear on the first midterm (but
will definitely appear on future exams!).

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Propositional calculus
\item Truth tables
\item De Morgan's laws
\item Distributive laws
\item Tautology
\item Proof by contradiction
\item Converse of a conditional proposition
\item Contrapositives
\item Quantifiers
\item Bound and free variables
\item Nested quantifiers
\item Even and odd numbers
\item Rational and irrational numbers
\item Divisibility
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Inspired by the homework}

The problems will be inspired by (but exactly the same as) homework
problems, so looking back over the homework problems is probably the
most efficient way to prepare for the exam.

One big difference, however, is that \textit{most} of the exam
problems will present you with a proposition, ask you whether it is
true or false, and have you prove it if it true, and provide a
counterexample if it is false.  This sort of question can be tricky,
but I think it forces you to wrestle with the mathematics, which is
good.

\section*{Problems}

There will be five problems on the midterm, each worth \textbf{360
  points}, for a total of \textbf{1800 points}.  The \textbf{fake
  midterm} will give you a vague idea of the sorts of problems you
might expect, but the fake midterm is much, much longer than the real
midterm.
