Ahlfors’ technique: subtract oﬀ the poles

f (z) =

1 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . w −z

f (z) =

1 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . w −z

Consequently, analytic functions are determined by their values on a circle.

f (z) =

1 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . w −z

Consequently, analytic functions are determined by their values on a circle. By a fractional linear transformation, analytic functions are determined by their value on the real line.

f (n)(z) =

n! 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . (w − z)n+1

Theorem (Liouville)
If f : C → C analytic and bounded, then f ≡ constant.

Theorem (Morera’s theorem)
If f : Ω → C is continuous, and γ f (z) dz = 0 for all closed γ, then f (z) is analytic.

Theorem (Morera’s theorem)
If f : Ω → C is continuous, and γ f (z) dz = 0 for all closed γ, then f (z) is analytic.

Proof.
So there exists F : Ω → C with F = f .

Theorem (Morera’s theorem)
If f : Ω → C is continuous, and γ f (z) dz = 0 for all closed γ, then f (z) is analytic.

Proof.
So there exists F : Ω → C with F = f . But then F is twice diﬀerentiable, so f is analytic.

Cauchy’s estimate

f (n) (z) =

n! 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . (w − z)n+1

Cauchy’s estimate

f (n) (z) =

n! 2πiη(γ, z)

γ

f (w ) dw . (w − z)n+1

Considering a circle of radius R around z, if |f (z)| is bounded by C on the circle, |f (n) (z)| ≤ C · n! · R −n .

If |f (Re iθ )| ∼ R n , what can you say about the derivatives of f ?

Removable singularities

f : Ω − {a} → C analytic can be extended to Ω → C iﬀ limz→a f (z) (z − a) = 0.

Removable singularities

f : Ω − {a} → C analytic can be extended to Ω → C iﬀ limz→a f (z) (z − a) = 0. Why? Cauchy’s formula is valid.

Apply this trick to F (z) = f (z) − f (a) z −a

and get f (z) = f (a) + (z − a)F (z).

Apply this trick to F (z) = f (z) − f (a) z −a

and get f (z) = f (a) + (z − a)F (z). Rinse, repeat.

Consequently. . .
If f : Ω → C is analytic, for any a ∈ Ω, we can write

f (n) (a) (z − a)n + F (z)(z − a)k+1 n!

for some analytic F : Ω → C.
