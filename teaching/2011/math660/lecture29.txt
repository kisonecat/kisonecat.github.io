Lecture 29: The maximum principle
Math 660—Jim Fowler Friday, July 30, 2010

Corollary
A nonconstant analytic function is an open map (meaning it maps open sets to open sets).

The maximum principle
Theorem
If f (z) is analytic and non-constant in a region Ω, then |f (z)| does not attain a maximum in Ω.

The maximum principle
Theorem
If f (z) is analytic and non-constant in a region Ω, then |f (z)| does not attain a maximum in Ω.

Proof.
A nonconstant analytic function is an open map.

The maximum principle
Theorem
If f (z) is analytic and non-constant in a region Ω, then |f (z)| does not attain a maximum in Ω.

Proof.
A nonconstant analytic function is an open map. Note that the maximum principle holds generally for open maps.

The maximum principle, version two

Theorem
If f (z) is continuous on the closed, bounded set Ω, and analytic in the region Ω, then the maximum of |f (z)| is attained somewhere on ∂Ω.

Analytic proof

Analytic proof
Apply Cauchy’s theorem, get 1 f (a) = 2π
2π

f (a + re iθ ) dθ
0

Analytic proof
Apply Cauchy’s theorem, get 1 f (a) = 2π so |f (a)| ≤ 1 2π
0 2π

f (a + re iθ ) dθ
0 2π

|f (a + re iθ )| dθ

Analytic proof
Apply Cauchy’s theorem, get 1 f (a) = 2π so |f (a)| ≤
2π

f (a + re iθ ) dθ
0

2π 1 |f (a + re iθ )| dθ 2π 0 and the theorem follows.

Lemma of Schwarz
Theorem
Suppose f (z) is analytic in the unit disk, and |f (z)| ≤ 1, and f (0) = 0. Then |f (z)| ≤ |z| and |f (0)| ≤ 1.

Lemma of Schwarz
Theorem
Suppose f (z) is analytic in the unit disk, and |f (z)| ≤ 1, and f (0) = 0. Then |f (z)| ≤ |z| and |f (0)| ≤ 1. In fact, if |f (z)| = |z| for some z or if |f (0)| = 1, then f (z) = λz for |λ| = 1.

Lemma of Schwarz
Theorem
Suppose f (z) is analytic in the unit disk, and |f (z)| ≤ 1, and f (0) = 0. Then |f (z)| ≤ |z| and |f (0)| ≤ 1. In fact, if |f (z)| = |z| for some z or if |f (0)| = 1, then f (z) = λz for |λ| = 1. Apply maximum principle to F (z) = f (z)/z.

Lemma of Schwarz
Theorem
Suppose f (z) is analytic in the unit disk, and |f (z)| ≤ 1, and f (0) = 0. Then |f (z)| ≤ |z| and |f (0)| ≤ 1. In fact, if |f (z)| = |z| for some z or if |f (0)| = 1, then f (z) = λz for |λ| = 1. Apply maximum principle to F (z) = f (z)/z. On the circle |z| = r , then |F (z)| ≤ 1/r , so |F (z)| ≤ 1 for all |z| ≤ 1.
