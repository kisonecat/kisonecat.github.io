Diﬀerent problems may be assigned!
This is probably not the ﬁnal version! The problems assigned on this homework set are subject to change! The ﬁnal version of Problem Set 8 will probably be ready by August 9, 2011.

Problem 1
Suppose f (z) is analytic in the annulus r1 < |z| < r2 and continuous on the closed annulus. If M (r) denotes the maximum of |f (z)| for |z| = r, show that M (r) ≤ M (r1 )α M (r2 )1−α , where log rr2 α= . log r2 r1

Discuss cases of equality.
