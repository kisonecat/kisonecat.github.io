Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v ,

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic,

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic, and we can ﬁnd f dz.

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic, and we can ﬁnd f dz. dv = − ∂u ∂u dx + dy . ∂y ∂x

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic, and we can ﬁnd f dz. dv = − ∂u ∂u dx + dy . ∂y ∂x

But in practice, there may be no conjugate harmonic function, so we take as a deﬁnition ∗du = − ∂u ∂u dx + dy . ∂y ∂x

And so

γ

∗du = 0 for cycles homologous to zero.

Simply connected regions

In a simply connected regions, γ ∗du = 0 for all cycles, so u has a single-valued conjugate function v .

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0
γ

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0
γ

Proof: If conjugate harmonic functions exist (e.g., in a simply connected region like a rectangle), then u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = u1 dv2 − u2 dv1 = u1 dv2 + v1 du2 − d(u2 v1 ) = (im(u1 + iv1 )(du2 + idv2 )) − d(u2 v1

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0
γ

Proof: If conjugate harmonic functions exist (e.g., in a simply connected region like a rectangle), then u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = u1 dv2 − u2 dv1 = u1 dv2 + v1 du2 − d(u2 v1 ) = (im(u1 + iv1 )(du2 + idv2 )) − d(u2 v1 so the integral vanishes.

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0
γ

Apply this to u1 = log r and u2 = u.

Mean-value property

Suppose u is harmonic in a punctured disk; then the arithmetic mean of u over concentric circles is a linear function of log r , 1 2π u dθ = a log r + β
|z|=r

and if u is harmonic in the whole disk, then a = 0.

Maximum principle

A nonconstant harmonic function has neither a maximum nor a minimum in the interior of a disk; the maximum and minimum on a closed bounded set occur on the boundary.

Poisson’s formula
If u(z) is continuous on a closed bounded set E , and harmonic in the interior of E , then it is uniquely determined by its values on the boundary.

Poisson’s formula
If u(z) is continuous on a closed bounded set E , and harmonic in the interior of E , then it is uniquely determined by its values on the boundary.

Can we get a formula for the function on the interior, given the values on the boundary?
