Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer.

Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer. Apply Taylor’s theorem to (z − a)h f (z), to ﬁnd

(z−a)h f (z) = Bh +Bh−1 (z−a)+· · ·+B1 (z−a)h−1 +ϕ(z)(z− with ϕ(z) analytic at z = a. Divide both sides by (z − a)h , to get f (z) = Bh−1 Bh + + · · · + ϕ(z) h (z − a) (z − a)h−1

The part before ϕ(z) is the singular part of f .

in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer. Apply Taylor’s theorem to (z − a)h f (z), to ﬁnd

(z−a)h f (z) = Bh +Bh−1 (z−a)+· · ·+B1 (z−a)h−1 +ϕ(z)(z− with ϕ(z) analytic at z = a. Divide both sides by (z − a)h , to get f (z) = Bh−1 Bh + + · · · + ϕ(z) h (z − a) (z − a)h−1

The part before ϕ(z) is the singular part of f . A pole comes with a well-deﬁned singular part, and if you subtract oﬀ the singular part, you are left with an analytic function.

Essential singularity
If there is no such α satisfying the limits
z→a

lim |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 lim |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞

z→a

then we say it is an essential singularity.

Theorem
An analytic function comes arbitrarily close to every complex value in a neighborhood of an essential singularity.

counting the zeroes and poles of an analytic function

Counting zeroes
Let D 2 = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} and f : D 2 → C analytic. Assume f (z) ≡ 0.

Counting zeroes
Let D 2 = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} and f : D 2 → C analytic. Assume f (z) ≡ 0. Assume f (z) has only ﬁnitely many zeroes, z1 , . . . , zn , with multiplicity.

Let D 2 = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} and f : D 2 → C analytic. Assume f (z) ≡ 0. Assume f (z) has only ﬁnitely many zeroes, z1 , . . . , zn , with multiplicity. f (z) = (z − z1 ) · · · (z − zn )g (z) for g (z) analytic and nowhere zero.

Now

g (z) γ g (z)

dz = 0, so f (z) dz = n(γ, z1 ) + · · · + n(γ, zn ) f (z)

In fact, this is true even if there are inﬁntely many zeroes in D 2

Now

dz = 0, so f (z) dz = n(γ, z1 ) + · · · + n(γ, zn ) f (z)

1 2πi

γ

In fact, this is true even if there are inﬁntely many zeroes in D 2 —why?

Theorem
f : D 2 → C analytic with zeroes zi . For closed curves γ not passing through a zero, n(γ, zi ) =
i

In particular, if we let Γ = f (γ), then dw = w Γ so n(Γ, 0) =

Local correspondence
Instead of counting zeroes, count how many times f (z) takes on the value a.

Local correspondence
Instead of counting zeroes, count how many times f (z) takes on the value a. If γ is a circle and n(Γ, a) = n(Γ, b), then f (z) takes on the value a as many times as the value b inside γ.

Theorem
Suppose f (z) is analytic at z0 , f (z0 ) = w0 ,a nd f (z) − w0 has a zero of order n at z0 . For all suﬃciently small > 0, there exists δ > 0, so that for all a within δ of w0 , the equation f (z) = a has exactly n roots in the disk |z − z0 | < .

Corollary
A nonconstant analytic function is an open map (meaning it maps open sets to open sets).
