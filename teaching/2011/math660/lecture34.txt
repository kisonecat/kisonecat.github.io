Let D 2 = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} and f : D 2 → C analytic. Assume f (z) ≡ 0.

In fact, this is true even if there are inﬁntely many zeroes in D 2 .

Corollary (Rouch´’s theorem) e
Suppose γ ∈ Ω with [γ] = [0] ∈ H1 (Ω), and n(γ, a) = 0 or 1 for a ∈ ω. Suppose f (z) and g (z) are analytic in Ω, and satisfy |f (z) − g (z)| < |f (z)| on γ. Then f (z) and g (z) have the same number of zeroes inside γ.

Finding zeroes via Taylor’s theorem

Suppose we want to know how many zeroes f (z) has inside BR (0).

Finding zeroes via Taylor’s theorem

Suppose we want to know how many zeroes f (z) has inside BR (0). Use Taylor’s theorem to write f (z) = p(z) + z n fn (z) for a polynomial p(z) with degree n − 1.

Finding zeroes via Taylor’s theorem

Suppose we want to know how many zeroes f (z) has inside BR (0). Use Taylor’s theorem to write f (z) = p(z) + z n fn (z) for a polynomial p(z) with degree n − 1. If we can prove R n |fn (z)| < |p(z)|, then we need only determine solutions of p(z) = 0.
