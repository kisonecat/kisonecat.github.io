Simple arc? Closed curve? Simple closed curve? Opposite arc?

Arcs and closed curves

Slogan: probe an object by considering curves on the object.

Angle between arcs?

A region is an open, connected set. Usually denoted by Ω.

Analytic in a region

A function f : Ω → C is analytic at x ∈ Ω if it is the restriction to Ω of a function analytic in an open set U ⊃ Ω.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose derivative vanishes identically is a constant.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose real part is constant, is constant.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose real part is constant, is constant. If f = u + iv , and u is constant, then f (z) = so f is constant. ∂u ∂u −i =0 ∂x ∂y

An analytic function in a region Ω whose imaginary part is constant, is constant.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose imaginary part is constant, is constant. If f = u + iv , and v is constant, then f (z) = so f is constant. ∂v ∂v +i =0 ∂y ∂x

An analytic function in a region Ω whose modulus is constant, is constant.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose modulus is constant, is constant. If f = u + iv , and u 2 + v 2 is constant, then u ∂u ∂v ∂u ∂v +v = 0 and u +v =0 ∂x ∂x ∂y ∂y

An analytic function in a region Ω whose modulus is constant, is constant. If f = u + iv , and u 2 + v 2 is constant, then u ∂u ∂v ∂u ∂v +v = 0 and u +v =0 ∂x ∂x ∂y ∂y

Now use Cauchy-Riemann equations—but how?

An analytic function in a region Ω whose argument is constant, is constant.

An analytic function in a region Ω whose argument is constant, is constant. Choose k so that u = kv .

An analytic function in a region Ω whose argument is constant, is constant. Choose k so that u = kv . Then the real part of (1 + ik)f is constant, so f is constant.
