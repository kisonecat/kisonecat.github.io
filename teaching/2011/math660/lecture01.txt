Math 660
Jim Fowler

This is a beginning graduate course in complex analysis; as such, we study analysis (e.g., the rigorous foundations of calculus) as it applies to functions of a complex variable. The resulting theory is strikingly beautiful.

Resources
We present 5 resources to help you to learn complex analysis.

The Complex Field

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d) i

The Complex Field

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d) i (a + bi) − (c + di) = (a − c) + (b − d) i

The Complex Field

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d) i (a + bi) − (c + di) = (a − c) + (b − d) i (a + bi) · (c + di) = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc) i

The Complex Field

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d) i (a + bi) − (c + di) = (a − c) + (b − d) i (a + bi) · (c + di) = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc) i a + bi ac + bd bc − ad + = c + di c2 + d2 c2 + d2

Putting complex numbers in order
If i > 0, then i 2 > 0, meaning −1 > 0.

Putting complex numbers in order
If i > 0, then i 2 > 0, meaning −1 > 0. If i < 0, then i 2 > 0, meaning −1 > 0.

Putting complex numbers in order
If i > 0, then i 2 > 0, meaning −1 > 0. If i < 0, then i 2 > 0, meaning −1 > 0.

Putting complex numbers in order

Something is wrong. . . The complex numbers aren’t ordered.

√ Why write i? Why not −1?
√ √ √ a b = ab

√ Why write i? Why not −1?
√ √ √ a b = ab But what if a = −1 and b = −1. . . ?

√ Why write i? Why not −1?
√ √ √ a b = ab But what if a = −1 and b = −1. . . ? √ √ −1 −1 = − (−1) · (−1)

There are two square roots. This is confusing. Choose one of them, and call it i.

Complex Conjugation
Deﬁnition
Deﬁne a + bi = a − bi. z = z. a + b = a + b. ab = a · b.

Complex Conjugation
Deﬁnition
Deﬁne a + bi = a − bi. z = z. a + b = a + b. ab = a · b.

Could you tell the diﬀerence between a world in which i was replaced by −i?

Powers of a complex number

We can now compute z p/q . By continuity, we could deﬁne z x for x ∈ R. What about, say, z i ? This will have to wait.

Stereographic projection
Extend C to C ∪ {∞}. Consider S 2 = {(x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ R3 : Deﬁne f : S 2 → C ∪ {∞} by z = x + iy = f (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x1 + ix2 1 − x3
