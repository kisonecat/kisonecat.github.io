Generalizing argument principle
If g (z) is analytic in Ω, then g (z) f (z) has f (z)

Generalizing argument principle
f (z) has f (z) residue h g (a) at a zero a of order h If g (z) is analytic in Ω, then g (z)

Generalizing argument principle
f (z) has f (z) residue h g (a) at a zero a of order h and residue −h g (a) at a pole a of order h. If g (z) is analytic in Ω, then g (z)

Generalizing argument principle
f (z) has f (z) residue h g (a) at a zero a of order h and residue −h g (a) at a pole a of order h. Therefore, If g (z) is analytic in Ω, then g (z) 1 2πi g (z)
