Pictures of harmonic functions

The Poisson integral produces a harmonic function, given values on the boundary.

Let’s see some examples!

Power series

Holomorphic means complex diﬀerentiable.

Power series

Holomorphic means complex diﬀerentiable.

Analytic means has a power series.

Power series

Holomorphic means complex diﬀerentiable.

Analytic means has a power series.

Now we show that holomorphic implies analytic.

Convergence of analytic functions
Suppose fn (z) is analytic in Ωn and fn (z) → f (z) in a region Ω, uniformly on compact subsets of Ω. Then f (z) is analytic in Ω, and fn (z) → f (z) uniformly on compact subsets.

Convergence of analytic functions
Suppose fn (z) is analytic in Ωn and fn (z) → f (z) in a region Ω, uniformly on compact subsets of Ω. Then f (z) is analytic in Ω, and fn (z) → f (z) uniformly on compact subsets.

Proof:

Convergence of analytic functions
Suppose fn (z) is analytic in Ωn and fn (z) → f (z) in a region Ω, uniformly on compact subsets of Ω. Then f (z) is analytic in Ω, and fn (z) → f (z) uniformly on compact subsets.

Proof: Morera’s theorem.

Zeroes and convergence

If fn (z) = 0 in a region Ω, and fn (z) → f (z) uniformly on compact subsets of Ω then f (z) is either everywhere or nowhere zero.
