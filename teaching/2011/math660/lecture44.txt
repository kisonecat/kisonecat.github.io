Partial fractions

π2 = sin2 (πz)

n∈Z

1 (z − n)2

Inﬁnite products

Usually, deﬁne ∞ pn by taking the limit of the “partial n=1 products,” provided the limit exists and is nonzero.

Inﬁnite products

Usually, deﬁne ∞ pn by taking the limit of the “partial n=1 products,” provided the limit exists and is nonzero.

By convention, the inﬁnite product ∞ pn converges if only n=1 ﬁnitely many factors are zero, and if the product converges (in the above sense) after removing those zeroes.

Some basic theorems

an converges implies lim an = 0.

Some basic theorems

an converges implies lim an = 0.

pn converges implies lim pn = 1.

Some basic theorems

an converges implies lim an = 0.

pn converges implies lim pn = 1.

So we may write pn = 1 + an with lim an = 0.

Logarithms

To compute

(1 + an ), perhaps consider

log(1 + an ).

Logarithms

To compute

(1 + an ), perhaps consider

log(1 + an ).

Choose principal branch of log.

log(1 + an ).

Convergence of

log(1 + an ) implies convergence of

(1 + an ).

Logarithms

Convergence of Why?

log(1 + an ) implies convergence of

(1 + an ).

Logarithms can get confused

Convergence of

(1 + an ) implies convergence of

log(1 + an ),

Logarithms can get confused

Convergence of (1 + an ) implies convergence of log(1 + an ), although log(1 + an ) may not converge to the principal branch log of (1 + an ), it converges to some logarithm of (1 + an ).

Inﬁnite products analyzed as series

In fact,

log(1 + an ) converges absolutely iﬀ

|an | converges.

Theorem
A nowhere vanishing entire function f (z) can be written as f (z) = e g (z) for some analytic function g .

Proof: f (z)/f (z) is analytic in the whole plane, so it is the derivative of some g (z).

Theorem
A nowhere vanishing entire function f (z) can be written as f (z) = e g (z) for some analytic function g .

Proof: f (z)/f (z) is analytic in the whole plane, so it is the derivative of some g (z). But f (z)e −g (z) has zero derivative,

Proof: f (z)/f (z) is analytic in the whole plane, so it is the derivative of some g (z). But f (z)e −g (z) has zero derivative, so f (z) is a multiple of e g (z) .
