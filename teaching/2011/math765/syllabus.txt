I will post handouts at http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~fowler/teaching/math765/.

Lectures
We meet Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 1:30–2:18p.m. in Scott Lab E0245 for a lecture.

Assessment
There are 1000 points possible in this course, broken down as follows. 10 problem sets (600 points; 60 points each). Homework is assigned each week, usually assigned on Monday, and collected the following Monday. You should work on the homework problems together, but you must write up your solutions independently. You must stay caught up with the homework. But I understand your schedules are very busy, so I will not penalize you for occasionally turning in late homework. Do not make a habit of it. 10 quizzes (50 points; 5 points each). Each Friday, we will have a short quiz. 1 ﬁnal exam (350 points). The ﬁnal examination will be a take-home exam, distributed at the last lecture and due the following Thursday.
