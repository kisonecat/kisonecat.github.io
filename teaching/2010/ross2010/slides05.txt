Some Philosophy
“Lines are made up of points? Really?”

Theorem

Theorem
A PL map f : K → L is a simplicial map from a subdivision of K to a stellar subdivision of L. Warning: The subdivision of K needn’t be stellar. Question: What does “subdivision” mean?

The combinatorial part
simplicial complex join link star Euler characteristic PL manifold: a complex K the link of each vertex PL homeomorphic (meaning stellar equivalent) to a sphere.

The non-combinatorial part
The notion of PL map is not quite general enough: a simplicial map from a stellar subdivision of K to a stellar subdivision of L is a PL map, but we will need more general maps.

To do this, we will place our simplexes in Rn .

The join of A, B ⊂ Rn is {λa + (1 − λ)b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B, λ ∈ [0, 1]}

Polyhedron
P ⊂ Rn is a polyhedron if for each p ∈ P there is a neighborhood N p so that N = p ∗ L, with L closed and bounded.

Polyhedron
P ⊂ Rn is a polyhedron if for each p ∈ P there is a neighborhood N p so that N = p ∗ L, with L closed and bounded. For example, N = {q ∈ P : d(p, q) ≤ }, but we allow more general neighborhoods.

Polyhedron
P ⊂ Rn is a polyhedron if for each p ∈ P there is a neighborhood N p so that N = p ∗ L, with L closed and bounded. For example, N = {q ∈ P : d(p, q) ≤ }, but we allow more general neighborhoods. N is called a closed star around p. L is a link of p.

Piecewise linear map
Let P, Q be polyhedra. f : P → Q is a PL map if each point p ∈ P has a closed star N = p ∗ L so that f (λp + (1 − λ)x) = λf (p) + (1 − λ)f (x) for x ∈ L and λ ∈ [0, 1].

In short, it locally maps conical rays to conical rays.

SPHERES IN FIVE DIMENSIONS
BY E. C. ZEEMAN

Communicated by S. Eilenberg, December 26, 1959

Given a semi-linear embedding of 5 2 in euclidean S-space, we show that it is unknotted. Join it up to a vertex V in general position. If the cone VS2 is nonsingular we are finished. Otherwise, for dimensional reasons, there are at most a finite number of singularities, where just two points of S2 are collinear with V. Let's have V away on one side, so that at each singularity we can call one point "near" and the other point "far." Now separate the near and far points by an equator S 1 , so that all the near points lie in the northern hemisphere A, and all the far points lie in the southern hemisphere B. Let S2 be the sphere VS^-VJB. Then S2 is equivalent to 5 2 , because they differ by the boundary of the ball VA, whose interior does not meet them. But S2 is unknotted because it bounds, and does not meet the interior of, the ball VB. Hence S2 is unknotted. n REMARK 1. The argument generalizes to unknotting S in &-space,
