Piecewise-Linear Topology
Jim Fowler

Manifolds are spaces which are locally modeled on Euclidean space, but might be globally twisted in some way; two-dimensional examples include a sphere or a torus. In contrast to the usual introduction to manifolds based on calculus and charts (that is, smooth manifolds), this course will study manifolds as combinatorial objects (that is, piecewise-linear manifolds). Piecewise-linear manifolds are more general than smooth manifolds, and because the basic deﬁnitions involve combinatorics instead of calculus, we will ﬁnd it easier to give rigorous proofs.

Homework
Problem sets will be distributed during most lectures.
