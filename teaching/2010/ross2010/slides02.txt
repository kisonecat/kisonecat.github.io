A problem with our deﬁnitions: we want to talk about S 2 , but there are so many simplicial complexes which deserve to be called S 2 . Our notion of simplicial complex is too rigid to be the right notion topologically.

Example
Let K be a circle with three arcs and L be a circle with four arcs (i.e., the boundary of a square). Then K and L are not simplicially isomorphic.
