Simplicial Complex

A simplicial complex K is a collection of ﬁnite sets (called the “simplexes”), with the property that if σ ∈ K , and τ ⊂ σ, then τ ∈ K .

Star
Deﬁnition
Let K be a complex, and σ ∈ K a simplex. The star of σ in K , written st(σ, K ), is deﬁned by st(σ, K ) = {τ ∈ K : σ < τ }, i.e., the star of σ includes all the simplexes having σ as a face.

Closure

Deﬁnition
Let S be a collection of simplexes in K . The closure of S, written as cl(S), is the smallest subcomplex of K containing the simplexes in S.

Link
Deﬁnition
Let K be a complex, and σ ∈ K a simplex. The link of σ ∈ K , written lk(σ, K ), consists of those simplexes in K which are in cl(st(σ, K )) but not touching σ; in other words, lk(σ, K ) = {τ ∈ cl(st(σ, K )) : τ ∩ σ = ∅}.

Stellar Subdivision
Deﬁnition
Let K be a complex, and σ ∈ K a simplex. The stellar subdivision of K at σ is a new complex Kσ with: the vertices of K with a new vertex v . the simplexes of K not in st(σ, K ), along with the simplexes in v ∗ (∂σ) ∗ lk(σ, K ). We might say: Kσ := (K − st(σ, K )) ∪ (v ∗ (∂σ) ∗ lk(σ, K ))

subdivision = repeated stellar subdivision

Deﬁnition
Let K , L be complexes. If K can be produced through a (possibly empty) sequence of stellar subdivisions of L, we say that K is a subdivision of L, and write K L.

Piecewise linear maps
Deﬁnition
Let K , K , L, L be complexes, with K K and L L. If f : K → L is a simplicial map, we call f : K → L a piecewise linear map (or a PL map for short). We call f : K → L an underlying simplicial map.

Piecewise linear maps
Deﬁnition
Let K , K , L, L be complexes, with K K and L L. If f : K → L is a simplicial map, we call f : K → L a piecewise linear map (or a PL map for short). We call f : K → L an underlying simplicial map. As we will see, the real deﬁnition of subdivision is more general than this.

Problem Set 2
Summer 2010

Piecewise-Linear Topology
Jim Fowler

Goal. Problem Set 2 introduces abstract simplicial complexes, the main object of study. You should be warned that what follows is not the only way to formalize our intuition. As usual, problems marked with a • should be written up and handed in.

Deﬁnition. Geometrically, an n-dimensional simplex (written ∆n , and usually called an nsimplex for short) is the n-dimensional analog of a triangle; just as a triangle is the smallest convex set containing 3 points which do not lie on a line, the n-simplex ∆n is the smallest convex set containing n + 1 points in “general position.” But for us, the important feature of a simplex is the relationship between the faces. Indeed, topologically, we do not care about the size of the simplexes, or where they are sitting in space—so we will abstract away the geometry, leaving only the combinatorics behind. A simplex A is a face of a simplex B if the vertices determining A are a subset of the vertices determining B. We write A < B if A is a face of B. Speciﬁcally, some v for which {v} ∈ B is called a vertex of B.

A simplicial complex K is a collection of ﬁnite sets (called the “simplexes”), with the property that if σ ∈ K, and τ < σ (i.e., if τ ⊂ σ when thought of as ﬁnite sets), then τ ∈ K.

In words, a simplicial complex is a collection of simplexes, where any face of a simplex is also in the complex. We can think of a simplicial complex as a geometric object by gluing together actual simplexes along their faces (the so-called “geometric realization”) by following the pattern of the combinatorial data encoded by the ﬁnite sets.

• Problem 1. Find an injective simplicial map)f : K7 → T 2 ; here, T 2 is the torus, and K7 ( 7 denotes 7 points connected in pairs by all = 21 edges. Use this to triangulate T 2 as a 2 simplicial complex with as few triangles as possible.
Problem 2. Does there exist an injective map f : K3,3 → S2 ? What about f : K3,3 → T 2 ? Here, K3,3 denotes six points, connected by nine lines, as shown on the right.

Anytime we deﬁne a mathematical object, we must also describe the maps between such objects. Let K and L be complexes. A simplicial map f : K → L is a function f : vert(K ) → vert( L) with the property that if σ ∈ K, then f (σ ) ∈ L.

Subcomplexes
Deﬁnition. If K and L are complexes, and every simplex in K is a simplex of L, then we write K ⊂ L and say that K is a subcomplex of L.

Example. The n-dimensional skeleton (usually called the n-skeleton) of a complex K consists of all those simplexes which contain n + 1 or fewer points (i.e., are at most n-dimensional). Write K (n) for the n-skeleton. We say that a complex K is an n-complex if K = K (n) .

• Problem 3. Prove that the n-skeleton of a simplicial complex K is still a simplicial complex.

Joins
Deﬁnition
Let K and L be complexes with disjoint sets of vertices (we call such complexes joinable). Deﬁne a new complex, the join of K and L, by K ∗ L := {σ ∪ τ : σ ∈ K , τ ∈ L}.

This is the end of the beginning. Problem Set 3 introduces manifolds, and with that, the last of the introductory topics; Please submit answers to problems marked with a •.

• Problem 1. Suppose K is a simplicial complex, with subdivisions K1 ▹ K and K2 ▹ K. Is there a subdivision K ′ so that K ′ ▹ K1 and K ′ ▹ K2 ?
Problem 2. Let K, L, M be complexes. If f : K → L and g : L → M are PL maps, how should we deﬁne the PL map g ◦ f : K → M?

Problem 3. For n ≥ 3, let Pn be the boundary of an n-gon. Prove that Pn ∼ Pm for n, m ≥ 3. = Thus, any Pn is topologically an S1 . Deﬁnition. A complex K is path-connected if for any two vertices v, w ∈ K, there exists a map f : ∆1 → K sending the boundary of ∆1 to v and w.
