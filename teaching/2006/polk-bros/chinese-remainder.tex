\subsection*{The Problem.}

You are a teacher, and there are definitely fewer than 30 students in
your classroom.  You also know that:
\begin{itemize}
\item When the students pair off, there is one student left over.
\item When breaking up into groups of three students, there are two
  students left over.
\item When breaking up into groups of five students, there are three
  students left over.
\end{itemize}
How many students are in your classroom?

\subsection*{Your solution.}
