Name:

Cows and chickens.
The Problem.
You are on a farm with two kinds of animals: • cows, which have one head and four legs, and • chickens, which have one head and two legs. Looking out into the pasture where the chickens and cows are grazing, you see 28 legs and 9 heads. Using this information, how many cows and chickens are on this farm?
