It is a surprising fact that every whole number is the sum of four squares. For example: 10 11 12 13 14 = = = = = 4+4+1+1 9+1+1+0 9+1+1+1 9+4+0+0 9+4+1+0

Write the numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 as the sum of four squares. Can every number be written as the sum of three squares?

Your solution.
