\subsection*{The Problem.}

You are on a farm with two kinds of animals:
\begin{itemize}
\item cows, which have one head and four legs, and
\item chickens, which have one head and two legs.
\end{itemize}
Looking out into the pasture where the chickens and cows are grazing,
you see \textbf{28 legs} and \textbf{9 heads}.  Using this
information, how many cows and chickens are on this farm?

\subsection*{Your solution.}
