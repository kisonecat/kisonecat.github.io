\maketitle

This is the final quiz---and rather than having it due during Reading
Period---which may be forbidden!---this quiz is entirely
\textbf{optional}.  You will receive the full 12 points regardless of
whether you do the quiz or not---but if you do hand it in, I will
comment on your solutions, which might be helpful practice for the
final.

\begin{problem}[4]
You work for a soup company, and you have been given $8\pi$ cubic
inches of soup.  Minimize the surface area of a cylindrical can
holding this volume of soup.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[4]
Imagine we live in a world where sheep prefer hexagonal fences (it may
even be this world; I'm not sure if any animals have polygonal
preferences).  You have been given 1200~feet of fence, which you can
divide into four pieces of length $x$ and two pieces of length $y$,
and then attach at 120~degree angles as shown:
\begin{center}
\psfrag{y}{$y$}
\psfrag{x}{$x$}
\psfrag{z}[b][B]{$\sqrt{3} \cdot x$}
\psfrag{w}[b][B]{$x/2$}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{hexagon-field.eps}
\end{center}
What lengths $x$ and $y$ should you choose to maximize the area
enclosed by the hexagon?  I have made some measurements of the dashed
lines (using properties of 30--60--90 triangles) which might help you
in your calculation.

\begin{problem}[4]
You are in a canoe (a $k\nu$?), one mile from shore, trying to get to
$Q$, your home, as \textbf{quickly} as possible.  Let $P$ be the point
nearest you on the shore; the distance between $P$ and your home $Q$
is ten miles.

Your plan is to paddle in a straight line (following the dashed line)
to some point $R$ on the shore, and then walk the rest of the way.
You can paddle $3$ miles per hour, and you can walk $4$ miles per
hour.  Describe the best place $R$ to land your canoe by reporting the
distance $x$ between $P$ and $R$.
