Math 133 Section 22 Due Monday, April 17
Problem 1. (3 points). Compute the following: ln x dx. x Problem 2. (3 points). Compute the following: (ln x)2 dx. Problem 3. (3 points). Consider the integral parts, by setting u = du = − This gives 1 1 dx = · x − x x Simplifying gives 1 dx = 1 + x Canceling the integrals on both sides yields 0 = 1, which is ridiculous! Where did I make a mistake? Problem 4. (3 points). Evaluate the limit:
x→0+
