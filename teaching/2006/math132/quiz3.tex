%This quiz is worth 14 points---12 points are for ``correctness'' of
%answers, but an additional 2 points will be given out for
%``style''---awarded to answers which are clearly written, easy to
%follow, etc.

For the following problems, if you claim that something doesn't exist,
you must \textit{prove} it doesn't exist.

In some sense, problems three and four are actually about soap
bubbles: problem three, for instance, is about minimizing the surface
area enclosing a particular volume, and this is exactly what bubbles
do.

\begin{problem}[3]
Find (if they exist) the local and global minima and maxima of the function $f : \R \to \R$ given by
$$
f(x) = x^4 - x^2.
$$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[3]
Find (if they exist) the local and global minima and maxima of the function $f : (-\infty,0) \cup (0,4) \cup (4,\infty) \to \R$ given by
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x \cdot (4-x)}.
$$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[4]
You are again working for a soup company.  This time, build a soup can
(i.e., a cylinder) holding $16\pi$ cubic units of soup, with the
surface area as small as possible.

%You are being chased on the coordinate plane!  Your current location
%is $(-1,0)$, and to get to safety, you must run to $(\sqrt{2},2)$.
%Through points with negative $x$-coordinate, you can travel at a speed
%of $\sqrt{2}$ units per second; through points with positive
%$x$-coordinate, you can travel at a speed of $1$ unit per second.
%Where should you cross the $y$-axis in order to get to safety in the
%fastest possible time?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[4]
You are a highway planner.  You must connect three cities, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{City A} & \mbox{ located at } & (-1,1), \\
\mbox{City B} & \mbox{ located at } & (-1,-1), \\
\mbox{City C} & \mbox{ located at } & (0,0),
\end{eqnarray*}
by three straight roads all meeting at a $3$-way intersection located
at $(x,0)$.  Where should the junction be placed to minimize the total
length of road needed?
\end{problem}
