Math 132 Section 22 Due Monday, February 27, 2006
Problem 1. (2 points). What is the area of the region above y = 0 and below y = 1 − x4 ? Problem 2. (2 points). What is the area of the region above y = x2 and below √ y = x? Problem 3. (2 points). What is the area of the region bounded on the left by x = 2y 2 − 4 and on the right by x = y 2 ? Problem 4. (2 points). Let R be the region bounded by y = 0, y = x2 + 1, x = −1, x = 1. Rotate the region R around the x-axis, and compute the volume of the resulting solid. Problem 5. (3 points). Deﬁne the following: √ Ra = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 ≤ y ≤ a2 − x2 , −a ≤ x ≤ a}, so Ra is a semicircle of radius a. Rotate Ra around the x-axis, and (using the method of disks) compute the volume of the resulting solid—which is a sphere of radius a. Compare your answer to the formula you know. Problem 6. (3 points). Let M be a very large number. Consider the region R given by 1 ≤ x ≤ M , and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1/x. Sketch the region. Rotate R around the x-axis, and compute the volume of the resulting solid in terms of M . What happens if you take the limit as M tends to inﬁnity?
