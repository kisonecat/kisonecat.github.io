Math 132 Section 22 Due Monday, January 30, 2006
For the following problems, if you claim that something doesn’t exist, you must prove it doesn’t exist. In some sense, problems three and four are actually about soap bubbles: problem three, for instance, is about minimizing the surface area enclosing a particular volume, and this is exactly what bubbles do. Problem 1. (3 points). Find (if they exist) the local and global minima and maxima of the function f : R → R given by f (x) = x4 − x2 . Problem 2. (3 points). Find (if they exist) the local and global minima and maxima of the function f : (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, 4) ∪ (4, ∞) → R given by f (x) = 1 . x · (4 − x)

Problem 3. (4 points). You are again working for a soup company. This time, build a soup can (i.e., a cylinder) holding 16π cubic units of soup, with the surface area as small as possible. Problem 4. (4 points). You are a highway planner. You must connect three cities, City A City B City C located at located at located at (−1, 1), (−1, −1), (0, 0),

by three straight roads all meeting at a 3-way intersection located at (x, 0). Where should the junction be placed to minimize the total length of road needed?
