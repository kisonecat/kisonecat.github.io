          h4 M&#246;bius strip as a configuration space
          p A M&#246;bius strip can be regarded as the configuration space of pairs of (indistinguishable!) points on a circle.

          h4 Percolation
          p A dot is drawn at a random location; if it does not overlap any previous dots, it gets a new color. Otherwise, the dot takes the color of the component it touches. Sometimes a new dot connects many components, and in this case, the new component takes on the color of the largest among the old components.
          p After drawing <em>n</em> dots, how many components should we expect to see?  When you draw only a few dots, most of those dots are isolated and have their own color; but after drawing a ridiculously large number of dots, they are all connected and the same color.

          h4 Reflecting triangles in the plane
          p Start with a triangle in the plane; reflect that triangle across its three sides; repeat, reflecting the resulting triangles through their sides, over and over again.
          p Observe how, for only four shapes of triangles, the resulting set of triangle vertices is discrete.  You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kWNyrRaQIw">watch the same thing with more triangles</a>.
