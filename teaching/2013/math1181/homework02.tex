I hope you've been enjoying
Math~1181H so far.  Ask yourself:
\textbf{are you doing the homework?}  If not, please try!  I can only
point you in the direction you should travel: you must make the
journey yourself.






\subsection*{Show your work}
When you ``solve'' a problem, the goal is not merely to give a correct answer!  Each problem has a story, and you should \textit{tell the story} by clearly explaining your argument.


\subsection*{The four boxed problems will be graded}
Even if you don't do all the assigned problems (though you should!), the four boxed problems will be graded.
