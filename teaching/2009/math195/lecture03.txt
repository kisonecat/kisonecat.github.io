Goal: section 13.3 and 13.4

Dot product
deﬁnition properties: • v · v = |v|2 • v · (w + u) = v · w + v · u • 0 · v = 0. • v·w =w·v • (αv) · w = α · (v · w) = v · (αw). use dot product to ﬁnd length. deﬁne unit vector. what does it measure: the angle v · w = |v| · |w| · cos θ. how to ﬁnd the angle prop: vectors v and w are orthognoal if v · w = 0. especially fun to ﬁnd angle with i, j, k.

0.1

Projection

project w onto v. use projection to write w as a combination of u and v.

0.2

higher dimensions!

we can do dot products in any dimension! can you compute the angle between two four dimensional vectors?

Cross product

cross product is something special about 3-dimensions—takes two vectors and gives another vector deﬁne cross product using the “circle ijk”. mention that the book uses determinants, but that we won’t do this. theorem: a × b is perpendicular to a and b. proof? dot products! theorem: |a × b| = |a| · |b| · sin θ. This is the same asthe area of the parallelogram. interactively deduce the varous properties of cross products commutative? associative?
