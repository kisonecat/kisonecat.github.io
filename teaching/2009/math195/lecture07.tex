\section{Functions of several variables}

examples of functions of many variables

what is the domain?  what is the range?  the book thinks of domain as
``biggest domain possible for the given rule.''  This is perhaps not
the best way to define the domain.

linear functions; quadratic functions, etc.

level curves---what does it mean when they are closer together?

level surfaces

\section{Limits}

definition of limit and definition of continuity

examples:
$$
\lim_{v \to 0} \frac{\sin ||v||}{||v||^2} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{(x,y) \to 0} \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \mbox{ does not exist.}
$$

use properties of limits, squeeze theorem,
