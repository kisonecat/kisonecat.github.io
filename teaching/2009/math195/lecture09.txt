Lecture 9: Chain rule
Math 195 Section 91 Friday July 10, 2009
Section 15.5 and section 15.6

1

Chain rule

ﬁrst example: diﬀerentiate f (g(t), h(t)). slightly more complicated example: f (g(t, s), h(t, s)). maximally complicated example

2

Directional derivative

deﬁnition relate to partial derivative

3

Gradient vector

deﬁnition relate gradient to directional derivative interpretation: normal to level curve, steepest ascent

4

Next time

optimization: ﬁnding the max, ﬁnding the min.
