\subsection*{Ungraded homework}

For practice at home, might I recommend:

Section 13.3, page 820, problems 3, 7, 11, 15, 17, 23, 35, 37. \\
Section 13.4, page 828, problems 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 33.
\end{quote}
The problems on dot products are \textit{extremely} important---you
must become very skilled at computing dot products.  The problems on
cross products are admittedly less important (since it only applies to
dimension 3), but they are a lot of fun.

\subsection*{Graded Quiz}

\begin{description}
\item[(a)] Compute the dot product of the vectors $(4,1,5)$ and $(-1,2,-3)$.
\vfill
\item[(b)] Find a vector of unit length pointing in the same direction as the vector $(2,-1,3)$.
\vfill
\item[(c)] For which $\alpha \in \R$ are the vectors
$$
(-6,\alpha,2) \mbox{ and } (\alpha,\alpha^2,\alpha)
$$
orthogonal?
\vfill
\item[(d)] Find the angle between the two vectors
$$
(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \mbox{ and } (\sin \theta, \cos \theta).
$$
Your answer should involve $\theta$, and not involve any trigonometric functions.
\vfill
\item[(e)] Let $v$ be the cross product of the vectors
$$
u = (1,2,3) \mbox{ and } w = (3,2,1).
$$
Compute $v$.  What is $u \cdot v$?  What is $w \cdot v$?
\vfill
\item[(f)] Find a vector which is orthogonal to both
$$
(1,t,2) \mbox{ and } (t,2,3).
$$
Your answer will, of course, depend on $t$.  It might be fun to draw a
picture of these vectors for different values of $t$.
