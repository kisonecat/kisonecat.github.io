Lecture 4: Lines and planes
Math 195 Section 91 Monday June 29, 2009
Section 13.5, and 14.1 and 14.2. parametric equation for line: v = tw + u. parametric equation for line segment.

1

Lines

ﬁnd line through two points check if two lines intersect skew lines versus parallel lines.

2

Planes

point on plane, and vector normal to the plane equation: n · (v − w) = 0 for w on the plane and n normal. write as scalar equation by substitting in coordinates ﬁnd normal vector by taking cross product two planes are parallel if their normals are parallel ﬁnd angle between two planes ﬁnd distance from point to a plane

3

Calculus

vector-valued function—in coordinates, a parametric equation! take limits componentwise sketch curve: (cos t, sin t, t).

4

Derivatives

deﬁne derivative take derivatives componentwise

1

ﬁnd unit tangent vector second derivative (on circle!) how to diﬀerentiate: dot products, cross products. it is the leibniz rule again!

5

Integrating vectors

Indeed we can do it.
