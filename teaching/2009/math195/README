Chapter 11:Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates, sections 11.1-11.3.  (3 classes)

Chapter 13, Vectors and the Geometry of Space, sections 1-5 (5 classes)

Chapter 14, Vector Functions, sections 1 and 2 (2-3 classes)

Chapter 15, Partial Derivatives, all sections (8-9 classes)

Chapter 16 Multiple Integration, all sections (6-7 classes) 

This leaves time for 2 tests, one holiday, and one reading and review
day. We suggest that the two tests take place in 4th week (after the
beginning of Chapter 14) and either 7th or 8th week (at the end of
chapter 15).
