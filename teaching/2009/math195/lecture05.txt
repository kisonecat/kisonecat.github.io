0.1

Functions of one variables

deﬁnition of derivative why is this the deﬁnition? derivative of vector-valued functions derivative of dot product, cross product

0.2

Functions of many variables

examples of functions of many variables what is the domain? what is the range? the book thinks of domain as “biggest domain possible for the given rule.” This is perhaps not the best way to deﬁne the domain. linear functions; quadratic functions, etc. level curves level surfaces Introduction to limits
