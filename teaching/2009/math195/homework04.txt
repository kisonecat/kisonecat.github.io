Ungraded homework
For practice, I urge you to try: Section 13.5, page 838, problems 13, 19, 27, 29, 33, 43, 65. Section 14.1, page 858, problems 5, 19, 21, 44 (even, but fun!). Section 14.2, page 864, problems 9, 11, 19, 23, 45, 51. Of these, the most important skill is knowing how to diﬀerentiate vector-valued functions.

Graded Quiz
(a) Let L be the line which goes through the points (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6). Give a vector equation for the line which goes through the point (4, 3, 2) and is parallel to L. (b) Write down an equation of the form ax + by + cz = d for the plane through the points (1, 1, 1), (2, 3, 4) and (0, 0, 1). (c) Let θ be the angle between the planes given by x + y + 2z = 1 2x + y + z = 1. Find cos θ. (d) Consider the function f : R → R3 given by f (t) = (t, t2 , t3 ). Find the unit tangent vector to the graph of f at the point f (t). (e) Let g : R → R2 be the function g(t) = (cos t, 2 sin t). Find g (t). (f ) Consider the functions

Do the graphs of a and b intersect? If so, ﬁnd the angle at which they intersect.
