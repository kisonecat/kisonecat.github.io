Graded Quiz
(a) Sketch the curve x(t) = (sin t) · (cos t) y(t) = cos t for t ∈ [0, 2π]. (b) Sketch the curve x(t) = sin (5t) y(t) = cos (3t) for t ∈ [0, 2π]. What sort of phenomena do you see when you use diﬀerent numbers in place of 5 and 3? √ (c) Consider the curve y(t) = log t, x(t) = t for t ≥ 1. By reparameterizing, ﬁnd a function f : [1, ∞) → R whose graph is the given curve. (d) Consider the curve described by x(t) = t2 y(t) = t3 + t. What is the slope of the tangent line to the curve through the point (x(t), y(t))? (e) Write down an integral whose value is the circumference of the ellipse traced out by the points (2 cos t, sin t) as t varies between 0 and 2π. Can you evaluate the integral?
