What are some rules that we can apply to limits?

1
1.1

Chiastic rules
The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
x→a

lim (f (x) + g(x)) = lim f (x) + lim g(x)
x→a x→a

1.2

The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
x→a

lim (f (x) · g(x)) = lim f (x) · lim g(x)
x→a x→a

2

Composition of functions

If f is a continuous function, then
x→a

lim f (g(x)) = f x→a g(x) . lim

3

Squeeze theorem
