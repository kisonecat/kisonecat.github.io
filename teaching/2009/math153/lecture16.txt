Administrative stuﬀ

Many thanks to those who ﬁlled out an online anonymous survey; very helpful! I especially noticed a consensus on doing trickier problems during lecture.

0.2

Recall

Series are not piles of numbers that we add up—they are lists of numbers that we add up, in order.

0.3

Overview

We have paid a high price (limits, series) and now we reap the rewards (Taylor series).

0.4

Taylor series

Goal: approximate ex (really, any function) by a polynomial. p0 (x) = 1 is a good approximation (gets the value correct at 0). p1 (x) = 1 + x is better approximation (gets the value and ﬁrst derivative correct at 0). p2 (x) = 1 + x + x2 /2 is yet better approximation (gets the value and ﬁrst and second derivative correct at 0). p3 (x) = 1 + x + x2 /2 + x3 /6 is even yet a better approximation (gets the value and ﬁrst and second and third derivative correct at 0). n General pattern: pk (x) = k x . n=0 n! Very generally: k f (n) (0) xn pk (x) = n! n=0

Is this useful?

Approximations are useless without error estimates. People often say π ≈ 3.14, but without knowing how good or bad an approximation this is, it is useless. I could just as well say π ≈ 5.

Theorem
1 Rn (x) = n!
x

If f (x) : (−a, a) → R, with n + 1 cts derivatives, then f (x) = pn (x) + Rn (x), where f (n+1) (t) (x − t)n dt
0

This is the exact error term—and if we know the error exactly, it isn’t much of an error—if we could calculate Rn (x) we could calculate the function.

0.7

Bounding the remainder
Rn (x) = f (n+1) (c) n+1 x (n + 1)!

Lagrange’s theorem:

where c is some number between 0 and x.

0.8

Remainder vanishes for large n

For instance, for f (x) = ex , the remainder looks like ec · xn+1 /(n + 1)!, which goes to zero. Consequence: ex = ∞ xn /n! for all x. n=0

0.9

Other functions

We can ﬁnd series for sin x and cos x—and these series converge to the corresponding function for all x.

0.10

Horrible truth

For any smooth function, we can write down a Taylor series—but we can’t be sure that it will converge unless we can show that the remainder term gets small. Example: f (x) = 1/(1 − x).
