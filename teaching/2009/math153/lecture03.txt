Lecture 3: Limits
Math 153 Section 57 Friday October 3, 2008
We will be following chapter 11.3. Here, we introduce limits, the most important idea in calculus, and that which distinguishes calculus from mere algebra.

Review of where we’ve been

Deﬁned “bounded” for sets and sequences. Deﬁned “monotone” for sequences.

1.1

Some loose ends: recursively deﬁned sequences

One person asked: is a sequence just a function? Yes! You’ve probably already studied functions R → R, and a sequence is a function N → R. A sequence (or a function) is not necessarily given by a formula: A weirder example: pn is the n-th digit of π. xn is the number of digits in the decimal representation of n. Another way to deﬁne sequences: deﬁne future terms by using past terms. Example: a1 = 2. an+1 = 2 · an . Increasing? This is just an = 2n . Example: a1 = 16. an+1 = 16 − an . Increasing? This alternates between 0 and 16. Example: a1 = 1, a2 = 1. an+2 = an+1 + an . Increasing?

Limits

Formal deﬁnition: limn→∞ an = L means for every > 0, there exists K such that n ≥ K implies |an − L| < . Intuitive deﬁnition: limn→∞ an = L means that as close as you want an to get to L, you can go far enough out in the sequence and stay that close. If an has a limit, then it is a convergent sequence, and we say it converges. If not, the sequence diverges (or is divergent).

2.1

Challenge-response

Think of the deﬁnition of limit as a challenge response game: the challenger gives you an , and you must produce the K. To prove that something converges to L, you must be ﬁnd a K for every . To prove that something doesn’t converge at all? You have to show that no matter what L you pick, there is some for which you can’t ﬁnd a suitable K. That sounds diﬃcult.

2.2

Example

Useful fact: for any b ∈ R, there is an n ∈ N with n > b. Useful fact: for any b ∈ R with b > 0, there is an n ∈ N with 1/n < b. If limn→∞ (2n + 1)/n = 2. Why? Set L = 2. We need to ﬁnd K so that for all n > K, we get |2 + 1/n − 2| < . If an = 0.9999 · · · 9, i.e., the n-term has n nines, then an = 1 − 10−n , and limn→∞ an = 1. To be precise? Set L = 1. Then need K so that for all n > K, we get |1 − 10−n − 1| < . That is, we need 10−n < , so we take log10 10−n < log10 , so we take n > − log10 .

2.3

Theorems

Limits are unique: if limn→∞ an = L and also limn→∞ an = M , then L = M . Limits only depend on their tails: if limn→∞ an = L and m ∈ N, then limn→∞ an+m = L. Convergent sequences are bounded. Unbounded sequences are divergent (awesome—a situation where we can show that no matter what L we pick, there is an for which we can’t ﬁnd a K).

Survey with closed eyes

One week is over: are we going too fast, too slowly, just right?
