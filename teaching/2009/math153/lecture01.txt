2.1

Review
Numbers

Natural numbers. Integers. Rationals. Reals.

2.2

Sets

The ∈ symbol. How to deﬁne a set?

2.3

Intervals

Open intervals. Closed intervals. Half-open intervals.

2.4

Bounds

A number b is an upper bound of a set A if for all a ∈ A, a ≤ b. A number b is a lower bound of a set A if for all a ∈ A, b ≤ a. Example: (0, 5). (−∞, 12). (2, ∞). [0, 5]. Example: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}. Example: {0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, . . .}. There may be many upper bounds; there may be none. A set is bounded above if it has an upper bound. 1

A set is bounded below if it has a lower bound. A set is bounded if it has both a lower bound and an upper bound.

Least upper bound axiom

Axiom: every nonempty set of real numbers bounded above has a least upper bound. Example: [0, 3]. (0, 3). Example: {0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, . . .}. Example: rational numbers?
