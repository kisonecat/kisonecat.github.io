Ratio Test
This is a test I do like, and it is easy to apply! If an > 0, and lim an+1 /an = L, then if L < 1, an converges, if L > 1, then an diverges, and if L = 1, the test is inconclusive. Proof: If L < 1, choose so small that L + < 1. Then there exists K so that for n ≥ K, we have |an+1 /an − L| < . In other words, an+1 /an < L + < 1. So an+1 < (L + ) · an . Therefore, an+k < (L + )n ak . But (L + )n ak converges, and therefore, by comparison, so does ∞ an . n=k

Best use of the ratio test
1/n! converges, because for n large 1 1 1 < < n! n · (n − 1) (n − 1)2

We know that

But we can also check this using the ratio test. Set an = 1/n!. Then an+1 /an = 1/(n + 1) which converges to zero, and we are done. What do we know about 1/n!? It equals e. We’ll see that soon. n Anti-example: n /n!. But we already knew that since lim nn /n! = ∞. n/2 Example: n /n!. Apply ratio test: √ (n + 1)n+1 n! ·√ n = (n + 1)! n which converges. n+1· ( n+1 )n n ( n+1 )n n = √ n+1

Which test to apply?
lim an = 0 is always a good thing to check! Integral test is good for things you can integrate. Root test is really only good for things with a powers of n. Limit comparison takes care of all rational functions (i.e., polynomial over polynomial). Ratio test is good for factorials.

Absolute and conditional convergence
Sometimes series have both positive and negative terms. Theorem: If |an | converges, then an converges. Proof: If |an |, then 2|an | conv, then an + |an | conv, so an = |an | conv. The proof doesn’t work backwards! Deﬁnition: an is absolutely convergent if |an | conv. Absolute convergence implies convergence, but it is not the same. Example: alternating series.

(an + |an |) −
