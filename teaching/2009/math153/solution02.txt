Due Monday, October 6, 2008
1. For each sequence, state whether it is bounded (and if so, above or below) and whether it is monotone (and if so, (non)increasing or (non)decreasing). (a) an = 2n . Bounded below but not above. Increasing. (b) bn = sin n. Bounded both below and above. Not monotone. 4n (c) cn = . Bounded both below and above. Increasing. n+1 √ n+1 . Bounded both below and above. Decreasing. (d) dn = √ n (e) en = (−1)n · n!. Not bounded. Not monotone. (f ) fn = cos 1 . Bounded both below and above. Increasing. n

(g) gn = 17. Bounded both below and above. Nondecreasing and nonincreasing. (h) hn = |5 − n| − n. Bounded both below and above. Nonincreasing. 2. Suppose an is a bounded sequence. Is the sequence bn = 17 · an also bounded? Why or why not? Yes. If bn is bounded above by U and below by L, then for all n ∈ N, we have L ≤ an ≤ U . Multiplying this inequality by 17 gives 17 · L ≤ 17 · an ≤ 17 · U for all n ∈ N. This means bn is bounded above by 17 · U and below by 17 · L. 3. Suppose an is a bounded sequence, and an = 0. Is the sequence bn = 1/an also bounded? Why or why not? No. Let an = 1/n. Then an is bounded, but bn = 1/an = n, which is not a bounded sequence. 4. Suppose an is a decreasing sequence. Is the sequence bn = 2an + 3 also decreasing? Why or why not? Yes. We assume for all n ∈ N that an > an+1 . Multiplying both sides by 2 and adding 3 gives the inequality 2an + 3 > 2an+1 + 3 for all n ∈ N. This means bn > bn+1 for all n ∈ N, so bn is decreasing. 5. Suppose an is an increasing sequence. Is the sequence bn = an 2 also increasing? Why or why not? No. Suppose an = −1/n. This is an increasing sequence, but an 2 = 1/n2 is not increasing.
