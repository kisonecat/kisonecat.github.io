Lecture 12: Convergence
Math 153 Section 57 Friday October 24, 2008
Following chapters 12.2 and 12.3.

Limit of terms of convergent series Convergence by boundedness
Theorem: series with nonnegative terms converges iﬀ bounded above

Integral test
If f continuous, positive, decreasing on [1, ∞), then
∞

f (k)
k=1

iﬀ

f (x) dx converges (i.e., as an improper integral). Draw some pictures apply integral test to prove harmonic series diverge. prove harmonic series diverges another way. apply integral test to p-series.

∞ 1

Comparison theorem
if ak ≥ 0 and bk ≥ 0, and for k large, ak ≤ bk

Then bk converges implies ak converges. 2 Example: 1/(2k + 3) Example: 1/ log(k + 5) by compariing with 1/2k. 1
