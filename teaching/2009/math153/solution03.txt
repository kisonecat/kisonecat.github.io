1. State whether the following sequences converge (and, if so, state the limit). (a) an = √ n. Since an is not bounded above, it diverges. 1 = 0 + 0 = 0. n→∞ n

1 (b) bn = 2−n + n . n→∞ n→∞

lim bn = lim 2−n + lim

(c) cn =

n+1 . n2

(e) en = (−1)n · n3 . Since en is not bounded (because, for instance, e2n > 2n), en diverges. 1 (f ) fn = cos . Because cos is continuous, n

1 n→∞ n lim

(g) gn = |10 − n| − n. If n > 10, then 10 − n < 0, so |10 − n| = n − 10. But then gn = (n − 10) − n = −10. So for large values of n, gn = −10, and therefore, lim gn = −10.
n→∞

3n (h) hn = n . We can use squeezing here. For all n ∈ N, 4 +1 0≤ 3n 3n ≤ n = 4n + 1 4 3 4
n

But the left-hand and right-hand sequences both converge to zero, so lim hn = 0.

(i) in = log (n + 1) − log n. Note that lim log 1 = 0. Since

n+1 = 1. But log is continuous, so lim log n→∞ n→∞ n n+1 n ,

in = log (n + 1) − log n = log we may conclude limn→∞ in = 0.

(j) jn =

3. Prove that if lim an = L and lim bn = M , then lim an + bn = L + M . 4. Let an be a sequence of real numbers, and set bn = |an |. If bn converges, does an converge? If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample. 5. Let an and bn be sequences of real numbers; suppose lim an = 0. Is it the case that
n→∞ n→∞

lim an · bn = 0?

If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample.

This is rather tricky; if you don’t answer it, you will not be penalized.
