We can give explicit -K arguments to prove 1 = 0, n→∞ n lim and lim xn = 0 if −1 < x < 1.
n→∞

Algebraic operations
If lim an = L and lim bn = M , then
n→∞ n→∞ n→∞

lim (an + bn ) = L + M,

n→∞

lim (an − bn ) = L − M,

n→∞

lim (an · bn ) = L · M,

and if M = 0 and all bn = 0, then lim (an /bn ) = L/M .
n→∞

Squeezing theorem
n→∞

If an , bn , and cn are sequences of real numbers, and for all n ∈ N, we have an ≤ bn ≤ cn , and lim an = L and lim cn = L, then lim bn = L.
n→∞ n→∞

Continuous functions
If a function f : R → R is continuous at L, and lim an = L, then lim f (an ) = f (L).
n→∞ n→∞

Subsequences
If an is a sequence of real numbers, and bn is a subsequence produced from an by throwing away ﬁnitely many terms, then an converges if and only if bn converges. If an is a convergent sequence of real numbers, and bn is a subsequence, then bn converges and lim an = lim bn .
n→∞ n→∞

Existence without construction
Theorem. If an is a nondecreasing bounded above sequence, then an converges. Theorem. If an is a nonincreasing bounded below sequence, then an converges.

for all > 0, there exists K ∈ N, so that if n ≥ K, then |an − L| < .
