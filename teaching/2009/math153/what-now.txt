What Now? When is the next lecture?
Well, it is over. This is it. There are no more lectures. But, with the end of calculus, your journey through mathematics has just begun!

More courses to take?
Keep taking mathematics courses! Math 195–196 covers the mathematics useful for economics courses; but let me also recommend the new Math 199, which will focus on proofs, and prepares you for Math 203–205, a year long course in analysis, after which you can take Math 254–256, a year long course in algebra.

Other educational experiences?
You can apply to the Directed Reading Program, where, if you are accepted, you will be paired with a graduate student mentor and work on an independent reading project. I can write recommendation letters for your application. You can also apply to the department’s VIGRE REU to do mathematics during the summer, here in Chicago.

More to read?
There are many excellent mathematics books available, depending on your tastes. • The Princeton Companion to Mathematics by Timothy Gowers, June Barrow-Green, Imre Leader. This new (2008) book is an amazing overview of modern mathematics. • The Knot Book by Colin C. Adams. This book is a lot of fun, and presents a totally diﬀerent side of mathematics than what you may have seen thus far. • Generatingfunctionology by Herbert S. Wilf. This book (available on the web) introduces generating functions—a way of using power series to answer combinatorial questions (like “how many ways can I ﬁll a 17 × 2 grid with 2 × 1 dominoes?”). • Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin. Analysis is Calculus with all the proofs included; this serious book is not easy, but is the standard textbook for many analysis courses. If you’d prefer some speciﬁc recommendations for something interesting and diﬀerent than Calculus, just let me know.
