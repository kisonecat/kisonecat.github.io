\section*{Vocab for Differential Equations}
\begin{itemize}
\item A differential equation is \textbf{ordinary} if the unknown function
is a real-valued function of a single independent variable.
\textbf{Partial} differential equations may include functions of many
variables.
\item The \textbf{order} of a differential equation is the highest
  derivative that appears in the equation.
\begin{example}For instance, $f''(x) =
  -f(x)$ is second-order, while $f^{(17)}(x) = e^x$ is seventeenth
  order.
\end{example}
\item An ordinary differential equation for the function $f(x)$ is
\textbf{linear} if it is of the form
\begin{equation*}
a_n(x) \, f^{(n)}(x) + \cdots +
a_1(x) \, f'(x) +
a_0(x) \, f(x) = g(x)
\tag{$\ast$}
\end{equation*}
for functions $a_i(x)$ and a function $g(x)$.
\item An ordinary differential equation for $f(x)$ is
  \textbf{homogeneous} if $f(x)$ (or a derivative thereof) appears in each
  term.  A differential equation is \textbf{inhomogeneous} if there is
  a term without $f$ or its derivatives.
\begin{example}For instance, a linear ordinary
  differential equation is homogeneous precisely when $g(x) = 0$ in
  equation ($\ast$).
\end{example}
\item An \textbf{integrating factor} is something you multiply a
  differential equation by in order to make it solvable.
\begin{example}
For instance, to solve a first-order inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equation, namely,
$$
f'(x) + a_0(x) \, f(x) = g(x)
$$
you should multiply by $e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx}$ so that
$$
e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx}\, f'(x) + e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx} \, a_0(x) \, f(x) = e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx}\, g(x)
$$
and then
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx}\, f(x) \right) = e^{\int a_0(x) \, dx}\, g(x).
$$
Now you can antidifferentiate the right-hand side to find an equation for $f(x)$.\end{example}
\end{itemize}
