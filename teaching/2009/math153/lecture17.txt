Lecture 17: More Taylor series
Math 153 Section 57 Wednesday November 5, 2008
Continuing in chapter 12.6.

0.1

Recall

• Start with a function f • Write down a Taylor series • Does the series converge? • Does the series converge to f ? How to ﬁnd a series? Diﬀerentiate the function. Or, maybe use a trick: substitute (e.g., 1/(1 + x2 )) or multiply two well-known series together. As we see soon, diﬀerentiation also works.

0.2

Taylor series

promised proofs.

0.3

Approximate π
∞

Here is a series arctan x =

n=0

(−1)n x2n+1 2n + 1

Since arctan 1 = π/4, we might try to approximate π this way.

0.4

Things you can see from the series directly

For example, sin(−x) = − sin x and cos x = cos(−x).

0.5

Relationship between ex and trig functions

eix = cos x + i sin x. 1

0.6

e is irrational

Assume e = a/b. Clever trick: deﬁne x = b!(e −

b

1/n!)
n=0

Step 1: x is an integer. Substitute in e = a/b to see this. Step 2: x is between 0 and 1. Then, 0<x= b! 1 ≤ = 1/b n! n=b+1 (b + 1)n−b n=b+1
∞ ∞

But there is no integer between 0 and 1. Challenge: do something similar for e2 .
