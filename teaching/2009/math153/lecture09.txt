Review for the test Existence without computation

Sometimes we can show that an improper integral converges without actually doing the calculation. This is the comparison test. ∞ If f and g are cts on [a, ∞) and 0 ≤ f (x) ≤ g(x), then a g(x) dx converges implies ∞ f (x) dx converges. And the contrapositive. a √ ∞ Example: 1 dx/ 1 + x100 converges because √ 1 < 1/x50 1 + x100

as long as x ≥ 1. √ ∞ Example: 1 dx/ 1 + x100 + sin2 x converges because √ 1 1 + x100 + sin x

Now you can! The following might be called a “l’Hˆpital’s rule for sequences.” Here, the diﬀerences of o successive terms take the place of the derivative: Theorem (Stolz-Ces`ro). Let an and bn be sequences of real numbers, both unbounded. a Assume bn is positive and increasing. If

an+1 − an =L bn+1 − bn

then lim an /bn = L.
