1 (b) bn = 2−n + n .

(c) cn = (d) dn =

n+1 . n2 n + (−1)n . n

(e) en = (−1)n · n3 . 1 (f ) fn = cos . n (g) gn = |10 − n| − n. (h) hn = 3n . 4n + 1

(i) in = log (n + 1) − log n. (j) jn = √ n2 + n − n.‡ 3 converges, n
n→∞

2. Give an -K proof that the sequence an =
n→∞ n→∞

3. Prove that if lim an = L and lim bn = M , then lim an + bn = L + M . 4. Let an be a sequence of real numbers, and set bn = |an |. If bn converges, does an converge? If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample. 5. Let an and bn be sequences of real numbers; suppose lim an = 0. Is it the case that
n→∞ n→∞

lim an · bn = 0?

If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample.

This is rather tricky; if you don’t answer it, you will not be penalized.
