I have built a right triangle, having a hypotenuse 48 cm, and height 23 cm. Use Lagrange’s theorem to bound R3 (1/2), and thereby justify that this is a good way to build a triangle having an angle of 1/2 radians. Question 37.

Musically, an important fact is that 219 ≈ 312 . Let’s see if we can show this using Taylor series. Taking logarithms, we ﬁnd 19 · log 2 ≈ 12 · log 3 But log 3 = log 1.5 + log 2, so 19 · log 2 ≈ 12 · (log 1.5 + log 2) which means that 7 · log 2 ≈ 12 · log 1.5 or by the Taylor series above 7 (1 − 1/2 + 1/3 + R3 (1)) ≈ 12 (1/2) − (1/2)2 /2 + (1/2)2 /3 + R3 (1/2) . Use a theorem on alternating series to bound R3 (1) and R3 (1/2) to show that this is possible.
