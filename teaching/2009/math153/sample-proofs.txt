Below are a list of statements that you can either prove (if the claim is true) or disprove (by exhibiting a counterexample). These are just for fun—statements to ponder if you are looking for more things to think about. Incidentally, there is a pattern (dare I say the beginning of a sequence!) to which statements are false, and which statements are true. And by my count, there are eighteen false statements in need of counterexamples, and seventeen true statements in need of a proof.

Prove or Disprove 13. If an is an unbounded sequence, then an+1 bn = √ n+1 is bounded. Prove or Disprove 14. If an is an unbounded sequence and an = 0 for all n ∈ N, then an+1 bn = an is bounded. Prove or Disprove 15. If an is a bounded sequence, then lim an /n = 0.
