Lecture 11: Series
Math 153 Section 57 Wednesday October 22, 2008
Following chapters 12.1 and 12.2.

Sigma notation
Write
N

fn
n=0

or

b

fn
n=a

Draw an analogy with integration. Some properties:
b b b

(αfn + βgn ) = α
n=a n=a b c

fn + β
n=a c

gn

and

fn +
n=a n=b+1

fn =
n=a

fn

Classic example:

b n=1

n = (b)(b + 1)/2

Inﬁnite series
Consider a series ∞ an . k=0 A partial sum is
n

sn =
k=0

an .

If limn→∞ sn = L, then we write

∞

ak = L
k=0

1

We call L the sum of the series. This is not the same as “adding up all the terms in the sequence.”

Example
The series ∞ 1 diverges. n=1 The series ∞ 1/2n converges to 1 (show the picture). Mention Zeno’s paradox, and n=1 the Singularity. The series ∞ (−1)n diverges. Thompson’s Lamp (every interval, the lamp switches on n=1 or oﬀ).

The most important example
Geometric series. If −1 < x < 1, then Proof: compute sk =
∞ n n=1 x = 1/(1 − x). For k n n=1 x . Multiply by (1

other values of x, the series diverges. − x) to get (1 − x)sk = 1 − xk+1 , so

sk = And take the limt as k → ∞.

1 − xk+1 1−x

Application
∞ 9 n=1 10n

= 1.

Wrong applications
∞ n=0

2n = −1? Uhm, no.

Theorems
Sum of convergent series are convergent. Products of convergent series by a constant are convergent.

Simplest criterion
If
∞ k=0

ak converges, then lim ak = 0.
