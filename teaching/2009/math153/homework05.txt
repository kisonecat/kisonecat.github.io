Remember: October 20 is the date of the ﬁrst midterm! (a) On page 558, section 11.5, do problems: 2, 10, 13, 17, 23, 27.

(b) On page 563, section 11.6, do problems: 3, 9, 14, 15, 21, 31.

(c) Deﬁne two functions as follows: f (x) = x + cos x sin x g(x) = esin x (x + cos x sin x) . f (x) . Since this is the indeterminate form ∞/∞, we apply x→∞ g(x) l’Hˆpital’s rule as follows: o We want to calculate lim f (x) = x→∞ g (x) lim 1 + cos2 x − sin2 x x→∞ esin x cos x (x + sin x cos x + 2 cos x) cos2 x + sin2 x + cos2 x − sin2 x = lim sin x x→∞ e cos x (x + sin x cos x + 2 cos x) 2 cos2 x = lim sin x x→∞ e cos x (x + sin x cos x + 2 cos x) 2 cos x = lim sin x = 0. x→∞ e (x + sin x cos x + 2 cos x) lim

(I left out some steps in computing the derivative of the denominator.) Therefore, by l’Hˆpital’s rule, the limit vanishes. Or. . . does it? Note that g(x) = esin x f (x), hence o f (x) 1 = lim sin x x→∞ g(x) x→∞ e lim which does not exist. Where did I make a mistake?
