Remember: October 20 is the date of the ﬁrst midterm! (a) On page 571, section 11.7, do problems: 1, 6, 9, 10, 17, 31.

(b) Consider the graph of f (x) = 1/x, restricted to x ∈ [1, ∞). Rotate this graph around the x-axis, to produce

The surface area of this object is inﬁnite, but what is its volume?

(c) The Gamma function is deﬁned as follows:
∞

Γ(z) =
0

tz−1 e−t dt.

Compute Γ(5). Hint: ﬁrst compute Γ(1), and then integrate by parts to ﬁnd Γ(z) in terms of Γ(z − 1).†

π/2

(d) Evaluate
0

x dx. This is an extremely diﬃcult integral. tan x
