(a) Recall our techniques: integration by parts, two half-angle formulas for exchanging sin2 x or cos2 x for something involving cos(2x), and the Pythagorean theorem for trading sin2 x for cos2 x (and vice versa). Use these techniques to ﬁnd: cos5 x sin5 x dx and cos4 x sin4 x dx

(b) Use the technique of partial fractions to evaluate the following integrals: (i) x + 27 dx. x2 − 9 8x − 36 dx. (x − 5)2

(ii)

(iii)

6x2 + 20x + 9 dx. x(x2 + 2x + 1)

(iv)

2x3 − 7x2 + 6x − 21 dx. (x + 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)

(v)

x2 − 3x + 46 dx. (x + 3) ((x − 1)2 + 16)

(c) Find a function f : R → R so that f (x) = f (x) · (1 − f (x)). Hint: Use partial fractions! Divide both sides of f (x) = f (x) · (1 − f (x)) by f (x) · (1 − f (x)) and integrate to discover f (x) dx = f (x) (1 − f (x)) 1 dx = x + C.

Make the substitution u = f (x), evaluate the integral on the left hand side, and then solve for f (x).
