\item[(a)] The change in volume of a melting object is proportional to
  its surface area.  The time is 2:22pm, and there are two ice cubes:
  the first has sides of length $2$~cm, and the second has sides of
  length $1$~cm.  At 2:30pm, the smaller ice cube has melted entirely:
  at what time will the larger ice cube disappear?

\item[(b)] Find the general solution to the differential equation
$$
f'(x) = \frac{-2}{x+1} \, f(x).
$$
\vfill

\item[(c)] Find the general solution to the differential equation
$$
f'(x) + f(x) = e^x
$$
\vfill

\item[(d)] Find the general solution to the differential equation
$$
x \, f'(x) - 2 \, f(x) + x = 0.
$$
Hint: find an ``integrating factor.''

\item[(e)] Find a solution to the wave equation
$$
f''(x) = -f(x)
$$
with $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(0) = 2$.
\vfill

\item[(f)] Find the general solution to the differential equation
$$
f'''(x) - 6 f''(x) + 11 f'(x) - 6 f(x) = 0.
$$
