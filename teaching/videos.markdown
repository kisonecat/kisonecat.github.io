You can find all my videos on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/kisonecat), including the [videos I
made for my Calculus
MOOCs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xtSdvkG-s&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLjOkVtsM_edKlAd5unZC0WxSUQTjv6Dpd);
many of my videos are also on [iTunes

### M&#246;bius strip as a configuration space

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOUW0cZRa3Y

A M&#246;bius strip can be regarded as the configuration space of pairs of (indistinguishable!) points on a circle.

### Percolation

A dot is drawn at a random location; if it does not overlap any
previous dots, it gets a new color. Otherwise, the dot takes the color
of the component it touches. Sometimes a new dot connects many
components, and in this case, the new component takes on the color of
the largest among the old components.

After drawing $n$ dots, how many components should we expect to see?
When you draw only a few dots, most of those dots are isolated and
have their own color; but after drawing a ridiculously large number of
dots, they are all connected and the same color.

### Reflecting triangles in the plane

Start with a triangle in the plane; reflect that triangle across its
three sides; repeat, reflecting the resulting triangles through their
sides, over and over again.

Observe how, for only four shapes of triangles, the resulting set of
triangle vertices is discrete.  You can [watch the same thing with
more triangles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kWNyrRaQIw).
