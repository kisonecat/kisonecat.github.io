\begin{document}
\maketitle

Welcome to Math~2568.  This is the first of 15 homework assignments which, although ungraded, will help provide some focus for your studies.







\subsection*{Show your work}
When you ``solve'' a problem, the goal is not merely to give a correct answer!  Each problem has a story, and you should \textit{tell the story} by clearly explaining your argument.


\subsection*{The two boxed problems have solutions in the back}
Even if you don't do all the suggested problems (though you should!), the two boxed problems really should be done since you can check your answers quickly in the back of the textbook.

\section*{Suggested Problems for Practice}

From \textsection 1.1 (starting on page 2),
do problems \fbox{9}, 10, 26, \fbox{27}, 32.
