The listed homework is a \textit{lower bound} on the number of
problems you should be doing: doing more homework is a good idea.


\subsection*{Midterm on Friday, September 20, 2013}
Remember to study for the upcoming midterm.




\subsection*{The two boxed problems have solutions in the back}
Even if you don't do all the suggested problems (though you should!), the two boxed problems really should be done since you can check your answers quickly in the back of the textbook.

\section*{Suggested Problems for Practice}

From \textsection 1.9 (starting on page 113),
do problems \fbox{3}, 4, 16, 28, 34, 48.

From \textsection 2.1 (starting on page 114),
do problems \fbox{19}, 20, 26, 32.
