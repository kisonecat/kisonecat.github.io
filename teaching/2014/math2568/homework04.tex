The listed homework is a \textit{lower bound} on the number of
problems you should be doing: doing more homework is a good idea.






\subsection*{The seven boxed problems have solutions in the back}
Even if you don't do all the suggested problems (though you should!), the seven boxed problems really should be done since you can check your answers quickly in the back of the textbook.

\section*{Suggested Problems for Practice}

From \textsection 1.6 (starting on page 61),
do problems \fbox{7}, 8, \fbox{9}, 10, \fbox{11}, 12, 16, 20, 26, \fbox{43}.
\vspace{1ex}

From \textsection 1.7 (starting on page 71),
do problems \fbox{11}, 12, \fbox{25}, 26, 30, \fbox{49}.
