\textit{The exercises below should be handed in on Monday.}  The first four questions are ``easy'' once we've discussed the ``signature'' of a manifold; the last two are concrete examples.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Euler characteristic]
  Let $M$ be a closed, simply-connected, oriented 4-manifold; show
  that $|\sigma(M)| \leq |\chi(M)|$.
\end{problem}

% novikov obstruction
\begin{problem}[Does it bound?]
  Is there a compact oriented manifold $M^5$ so that $\partial M =
  \CP^2$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Odd-dimensional signature]
  Is $(\CP^2)^{17}$ homeomorphic to a product of odd-dimensional
  manifolds?
\end{problem}

% novikov additivity
\begin{problem}[Splitting]
  Can you find a smoothly embedded submanifold $N^3$ of $\CP^2$ so that $\CP^2 - N^3$ has two components?  Can you arrange it so that each of those two components have zero signature?
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}[Connected sum]
  Suppose $M^4$ is a connected, orientable, closed 4-manifold with $H^2(M) = \Z^2$, generated by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so that
\begin{align*}
\alpha  \smallsmile \alpha &= [M], \\
\alpha  \smallsmile \beta &= [M], \\
\beta  \smallsmile \beta &= 0. \\
\end{align*}
Is it possible that there are manifolds $N_1$ and $N_2$ so that $N_1
\# N_2 = M$?  If not, explain why not; if so, exhibit such manifolds.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Linking number redux]
  Recall that $S^3 = S^1 \star S^1$, where $\star$ denotes the
  ``join'' operation.  What is the linking number (up to sign) of the
  left and right hand $S^1$ and $S^1$ in the join?
\end{problem}
