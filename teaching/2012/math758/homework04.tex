\begin{problem}[Hatcher page 259, problem 16]
  Show that $(\alpha \smallfrown \varphi) \smallfrown \psi = (\alpha
  \smallfrown (\varphi \smallsmile \psi)$ for all $\alpha \in
  C_k(X;R)$ and $\varphi \in C^\ell(X;R)$ and $\psi \in C^m(X;R)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Natural]
In what sense do cup product and cap product satisfy naturality?
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[An explicit example]
  Let $\Sigma_2$ be the orientable genus two surface, and $[\Sigma_2]
  \in H_2(\Sigma_2)$ its fundamental class.  Show that the map
  $[\Sigma_2] \smallfrown - : H^1(\Sigma_2) \to H_1(\Sigma_2)$ is an
  isomorphism.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Product of spheres]
  For each class $x \in H_{2n}(S^n \times S^n)$, determine $x \smallfrown
  - : H^n(S^n \times S^n) \to H_n(S^n \times S^n)$.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Hatcher page 258, problem 7]
  Show that for any connected closed orientable $n$-manifold $M$,
  there is a degree $1$ map $M \to S^n$.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[No degree one map]
  Show that there is a connected closed orientable $n$-manifold $M$
  for which there is no degree $1$ map $S^n \to M$.
\end{problem}

\begin{hardproblem}[Flexible manfiolds]
  An oriented closed connected manifold is \textit{flexible} if it
  admits a self-map that has degree not zero or $\pm 1$.  Show that
  $S^k$, and $\RP^{2k+1}$, and $\CP^k$, and any products of such are
  flexible.
