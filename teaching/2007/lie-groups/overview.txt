Undergraduate Lie Theory Seminar
A Lie group is a manifold which is also a group, and consequently Lie groups combine algebra, topology, geometry, and analysis. They appear everywhere, and our goal this quarter (or longer) is to understand these ubiquitous and beautiful objects more deeply. Our goal will be to classify the simple compact Lie groups, and to do so in as geometric (as opposed to algebraic) a way as possible.

Plan of Attack
Right now, our plan might go as follows.

Combinatorial background.
We will work through the deﬁnitions and basic properties of Coxeter groups and root systems. A good reference is Grove and Benson, Finite Reﬂection Groups. This will introduce Dynkin diagrams and the ADE classiﬁcation—a classiﬁcation that appears throughout mathematics, from regular polytopes, to Lie algebras, Lie groups, singularities, quivers. . .

Lie groups.
A nice references for Lie groups, done very geometrically, is Frank Adams, Lectures on Lie Groups. This will introduce us to Lie groups and we will see the importance of maximal tori.

Representations.
A nice reference here is Fulton and Harris, Representation Theory, A First Course. This book is problem-based, and works through examples in fantastic detail, with lovely pictures of the root systems.
