<h3><a href="/teaching/2014/m2o2c2/">M2O2C2: Massively
multivariable open online calculus course</a></h3>
<p>M2O2C2 is an invitation to think carefully about how one thing
changing affects something else. What is the "derivative" of a
function of many variables? How can a curved object be approximated
by a flat plane? What does the chain rule look like when many
things are affecting many other things? How do we find an input
which maximizes a function of many variables?</p>
<p>This is a course in multivariable differential calculus, but we
will also introduce a ton of linear algebra. The result is a course
targeted at a student who has seen a bit of calculus and is willing
to learn about matrices and vectors to provide the best possible
vantage point from which to understand derivatives of functions of
many variables.</p>

<h3><a href="/teaching/2014/calculus-two/">Calculus Two: Sequences
and Series</a></h3>
<p>Sequences and Series will challenge us to think very carefully
about "infinity." What does it mean to add up an unending list of
numbers? How can an infinite task result in a finite answer? These
questions lead us to some very deep conceptsâ€”but also to some
powerful computational tools which are used not only in math but in
many quantitative disciplines.</p>
<p>This course is a first introduction to sequences, infinite
series, convergence tests, and Taylor series. It is suitable for
someone who has seen just a bit of calculus before.</p>

<h3><a href="/teaching/2013/calculus-one/">Calculus One</a></h3>
<p>Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things
change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends
up explaining the real world. Calculus plays a starring role in the
biological, physical, and social sciences. This online course is a
first and friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone
who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen
some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice
applying those concepts to solve problems.</p>
