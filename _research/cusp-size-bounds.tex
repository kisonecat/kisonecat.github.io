Singular maps of surfaces into a hyperbolic 3-manifold are utilized to find upper bounds on meridian length, $\ell$-curve length and maximal cusp volume for the manifold. This allows a proof of the fact that there exist hyperbolic knots with arbitrarily small cusp density and that every closed orientable 3-manifold contains a knot whose complement is hyperbolic with maximal cusp volume less than or equal to 9.

We also find particular upper bounds on meridian length, $\ell$-curve length and maximal cusp volume for hyperbolic knots in $S^3$ depending on crossing number. Particular improved bounds are obtained for alternating knots.
