<p>Here's a little movie I made:</p>

<%= movie( "mobius.m4v" ) %>

<p>I'm grading for the first year topology course at Chicago, and one of their homework problems asked them to show that pairs of (indistinguishable!) points on a circle correspond to points on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MÃ¶bius_strip">M&ouml;bius strip</a>; in other words, the quotient of the torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ by the $\Z/2$-action which exchanges the two $S^1$ factors is a M&ouml;bius strip.</p>

<p>In the above animation, you can see the identification in action: the two red points on the green circle correspond to the red dot on the M&ouml;bius strip.</p>
