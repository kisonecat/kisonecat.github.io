  Two interesting things about taking a bath...

The first was, while singing in the bathtub, I hit a resonant frequency, and I wondered: what can be deduced about the shape of my bathtub (well, bathroom) from this frequency?

The second was that I heard something fall into Tasha's water dish; thinking nothing of it, I was rather shocked (well, not literally shocked, but...) to find that it was my *cell phone* that had fallen into Tasha's water.  Uh oh.

And now I am trying to dry it off with a hairdryer.
