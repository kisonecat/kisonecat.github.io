  I tried making bread, but with significantly less flour than neccessary (and therefore, far more water than needed).  The result was very much like *cooked paste*.  It was pointed out to me that since the essence of bread is flour, trying to get by with less flour was undermining the very *essence of bread* (and I find such arguments very satisfying).

I also made baklava again, and that turned out much better than the first time (which involved the baklava burning).
