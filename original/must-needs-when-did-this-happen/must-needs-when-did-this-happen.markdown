  Perhaps a half-dozen times in the past week, I've read sentences with contain the phrase "must needs."  I have never considered this construction before; frankly, it sounds totally bizarre to my inner ear (my spiritual inner ear, that is).

Thus, it must needs be that I've been teleported to another world, a world in which the English language developed differently than it did in the world from which I came.  This tiny grammatical gem is the only evidence of my true origin.
