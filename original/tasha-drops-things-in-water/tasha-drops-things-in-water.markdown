  Often, Tasha picks something up (say, a pen, or a lego), carries it around, and then drops it into her water bowl.  I have no idea what she is thinking when she does this.  On the topic of cat thoughts, the [Wikipedia article on cats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats) observes:

> Some theories suggest that cats see their owners gone for long times of the day and assume they are out hunting, as they always have plenty of food available.

I desperately hope that Tasha believes that I am out hunting (mathematics?).  In any case, seeing her carry the legos around answers an old question of mine: about two months ago, I noticed that lego pieces were "mysteriously" appearing in my shoes.  The Wikipedia article goes on to note that:

> It is thought that a cat presenting its owner with a dead animal thinks it's 'helping out' by bringing home the kill.

In other news, the welcome dinner for [GCF](http://ucgcf.org/) went spectacularly well; afterwards, we played *Loaded Questions*, and I learned that people associate tildes with me to a much stronger degree than I would have believed.
