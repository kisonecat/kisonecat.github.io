<a href="http://www.hevle.com/">Drew Hevle</a> raises a very interesting question: suppose you are stranded on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_island">desert island</a>; what books would be entirely <b>useless</b> in this situation?

Here are a few books that <b>I wouldn't want to be stranded on an island with</b>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=therepubliofk-20&path=ASIN/0808016903/">Federal Income Tax: Code and Regulations Selected Sections</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=therepubliofk-20&path=ASIN/0833030477/">A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=therepubliofk-20&path=ASIN/0780803450">Government Phone Book USA 2000</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=therepubliofk-20&path=ASIN/0393732150">How to Build an Igloo: And Other Snow Shelters</a></li>
</ul>
Do you have <b>other ideas for awful desert island reading?</b>
