I am frequently amazed to discover that songs which I had believed to have been original are actually covers.  It turns out, for instance, that TMBG's "Istanbul (not Constantinople)" is a cover of a song from the 1950s.

Ironically, one might argue that Istanbul is itself a cover of Constantinople--and that argument (unifying form and content) reminds me of the language games played by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0060084685%26tag=therepubliofk-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0060084685%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Salt: Grain of Life</a>, a book asserting that its very structure resembles the culinary crystal it purports to discuss.
