I'm fond of the *Pineapple Sauce Pancake* graph: the vertices are English words, and there is an edge from $a$ to $b$ if $ab$ is also an English word (e.g., "pan" and "cake" are English words, and there is an edge from "pan" to "cake" because "pancake" is also an English word).

To play around with this, I wrote a [Javascript program](http://math.uchicago.edu/~fowler/pineapple/), complete with a [Web 2.0 logo](http://msig.info/web2.php)--which reminds me, I wonder if there is an interpreter for the programming language logo, written in Javascript?

Anyway, what I *really* wanted to do was to make a wall-sized picture of the Pineapple Graph, but [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) isn't quite able to handle it, but maybe with some tweaking, I'd be able to produce a beautiful poster.
