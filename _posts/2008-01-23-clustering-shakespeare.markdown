I ran my clustering program (which I just ran on the <a href="<%= blog_root %>posts/clustering-the-new-testament/">New Testament</a>) on <b>Shakespeare's plays</b>&mdash;which were conveniently packaged into a text file by <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/">Open Source Shakespeare</a>.

The result was the following graph:

<div class="displayedMedia"><img src='shakespeare.png' alt='Clustering of Shakespeareâ€™s Plays' /></div>

I know little about Shakespeare, so I can't say too much about the above image.  I'd love to know what you think: <b>does this arrangement of his plays make any sense?</b>

Given that modern processors are so good at vector and matrix calculations, I'm surprised that this sort of visualization tool doesn't appear in more places.  For instance,
<ul>
<li>Your blogs and email could be organized this way.  Imagine lasso-ing a bunch of similar emails to reply to them all at once!</li>
<li>News could be organized into nice piles.</li>
<li>Your desktop and personal files could be arranged automatically into relevant piles.</li>
</ul>
Then again, maybe the idea of piles appeals to me more than most people&mdash;just look at how I organize the papers and books on my desk!
