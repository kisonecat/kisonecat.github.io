I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> this summer again, and I'm watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El-Hazard">El Hazard</a> now.  I am extremely tempted to purchase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Cities_of_Gold">Mysterious Cities of Gold</a> DVD's---does anyone else remember how awesome that was?

My cat <a href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fowler/gallery/view_photo.php?full=1&set_albumName=tasha&id=DCP_0003">Tasha</a> is beautiful, and I will miss her while I am in Berkeley.

I am extraordinarily excited by the possibility that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a> might, in his epic quest to author a musical tribute for all 50 states, choose Minnesota next.  Perhaps I am swayed by the fact that I am listening to Sufjan Stevens' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avalanche">The Avalanche</a>, and realizing again that I rather love him.

And I spend quite a bit of time brushing my teeth everyday, but I rather rarely discuss toothbrushing technique, or, for instance, how I learned to brush my teeth.
