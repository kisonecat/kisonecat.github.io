I am still in California, and very much enjoying public transportation.  Yesterday, I took AC Transit's 65 bus (the "Euclid" bus) along an extremely (and therefore ironically) curvy road to get off the mountain of MSRI.  (The "mountain of misery" belongs in a fantasy novel.)

There's a lot of people in California I would still like to see.

Here is a *really* stupid question: If I have a wire (with a changing current) and I bend it around, and measure the induced current in (a finite number of) neighboring coils, can I determine anything about how I have bent the wire?  Being more ridiculous, I will weave together wires to make fabric.  How do the electrical properties of the fabric relate to its shape?  That is, if I run current along one wire, and measure the induced current in other wires, can I deduce anything about how I have bent the fabric?

It strikes me as amusing to measure the speed of something by, say, attaching a magnet to the wheel and then seeing how quickly the magnet is moving past a coil.  I wonder how sensitive this would have to be, say, to work as a bicycle speedometer.

Anyway, this is the stuff that bothers me on the bus.  Right now, it is my inability to produce more examples of hyperbolic n-manifolds that is bothering me.
