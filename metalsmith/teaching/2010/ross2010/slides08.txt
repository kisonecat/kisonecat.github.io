Goal: “Unknotting combinatorial balls” a paper in the Annals

Main result

Any embedding S p ⊂ S q is unknotted, if q − p ≥ 3.

Main result
Theorem

Any embedding S p ⊂ S q is unknotted, if q − p ≥ 3.
Corollary

Advertisement
There are now other ways to prove Zeeman’s result.

The technical lemmas do some “heavy lifting” and I am curious if there are other applications of the machinery in Zeeman’s paper.

Pairs
Deﬁnition
“(p, q)-sphere pair” means S q ⊂ S p . We sometimes write (S p , S q ). “(p, q)-ball pair” means B q ⊂ B p , with B q properly embedded in B p , meaning ∂B q ⊂ ∂B p and int B q ⊂ int B p . We sometimes write (B p , B q ). “Pair” means either a ball-pair or sphere-pair. ∂(B p , B q ) = (S p−1 , S q−1 ).

Joins of pairs
(S p , S q ) ∗ S k is a sphere pair. (S p , S q ) ∗ B k is a ball pair. (B p , B q ) ∗ S k is a ball pair. (B p , B q ) ∗ B k is a ball pair. We’ll call the join of a pair and a point a cone pair.

Subpairs
X = (X p , X q ) and Y = (Y r , Y s ) are pairs we say Y is a subpair of X (written Y ⊂ X or X ⊃ Y ) if Y r ⊂ X p and T s = X q ∩ Y r . If P = (S p , S q ) ⊃ Q = (B p , B q ), then P − int Q = (S p − int B p , S q − int B q ) is a ball pair (via regular neighborhood machinery).

Faces of pairs
If Q = (B p−1 , B q−1 ) is contained in the boundary of Q = (B p , B q ), we call Q a face of Q.

Theorem
If ball pairs intersect in their common boundary, their union is a sphere pair.

Faces of pairs
If Q = (B p−1 , B q−1 ) is contained in the boundary of Q = (B p , B q ), we call Q a face of Q.

Theorem
If ball pairs intersect in their common boundary, their union is a sphere pair.

Theorem
If ball pairs intersect in a face, their union is a ball pair.

Standard pairs
Γp,q = (S p−q ∆q , ∆q ) is the standard (p, q)-ball pair. ∂Γp+1,q+1 is the standard (p, q)-sphere pair.

A pair is unknotted if it is homeomorphic to a standard pair.

Theorem (BallThmp,q )
If p − q ≥ 3, then any (p, q)-ball pair is unknotted.

Theorem (SphereThmp,q )
If p − q ≥ 3, then any (p, q)-sphere pair is unknotted.

Theorem (BallThmp,q )
If p − q ≥ 3, then any (p, q)-ball pair is unknotted.

Theorem (SphereThmp,q )
If p − q ≥ 3, then any (p, q)-sphere pair is unknotted.
