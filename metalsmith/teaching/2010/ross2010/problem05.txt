Piecewise-Linear Topology
Jim Fowler

Ceci n’est pas une Problem Set. Instead of questions, this sheet records the deﬁnitions we will be working with; here, we leave the realm of abstract simplicial complexes, and embrace the geometry—our simplexes are now situated in space. Deﬁnition. The join of A, B ⊂ R n is

A ∗ B = {λa + µb : a ∈ A,

b ∈ B,

λ ∈ [0, 1],

µ ∈ [0, 1],

λ + µ = 1}

Imagine this as connecting A and B by including all line segments between points in A and points in B.

A and B are independent if each point in A ∗ B can be written uniquely as λa + µb, for a ∈ A, b ∈ B, λ, µ ∈ [0, 1], λ + µ = 1.

Polyhedra
Deﬁnition. P ⊂ R n is a polyhedron if, for each p ∈ P, there is a neighborhood N ∋ p, so that N = p ∗ L, with L closed and bounded (in other words, compact). In this case, N is called a closed star around p, and L is a link of p. A subpolyhedron of P is a subset Q ⊂ P which is also a polyhedron. Deﬁnition. Let P, Q be polyhedra. Then f : P → Q is a piecewise-linear map (a PL map, for short) if each point p ∈ P has a closed star N = p ∗ L so that f (λp + µx ) = λ f ( p) + µ f ( x ) for x ∈ L and λ, µ ∈ [0, 1] with λ + µ = 1. A PL homeomorphism is a PL map with a PL inverse. Deﬁnition. A PL map f : P → Q is a piecewise linear embedding if f ( P) is a subpolyhedron of Q, and f : P → f ( P) is a PL homeomorphism.

Manifolds
Deﬁnition. A polyhedron P is an n-dimensional PL manifold if each p ∈ P has an open neighborhood N ∋ p which is PL homeomorphic to an open set in R n . In this case, we call N with the PL homeomorphism a coordinate neighborhood. A polyhedron P is an n-dimensional PL manifold with boundary if each point p ∈ P has an open neighborhood N ∋ p which is PL homeomorphic to an open subset of R n−1 × R ≥0 . The boundary of P (written ∂P) consists of points p ∈ P which are identiﬁed with R n −1 × { 0 } ⊂ R n −1 × R ≥0 . A manifold P is closed if ∂P = ∅ and P is compact. Deﬁnition. The n-ball Bn (sometimes called the n-disk D n ) is any manifold PL homeomorphic to [0, 1]n . The n-sphere is any manifold PL homeomorphic to ∂[0, 1]n+1 .

Cell complexes
Deﬁnition. A subset C ∈ R n is convex if for any p, q ∈ C, the segment { p} ∗ {q} is contained in C. Deﬁnition. A compact convex subset C ∈ R n is a k-dimensional cell if it spans a kdimensional subspace. For x ∈ C, deﬁne ⟨ x, C ⟩ to be the union of { x } and all lines L such that L ∩ C contains x in its interior. The subset Cx = C ∩ ⟨ x, C ⟩ is the face of C containing x. Write D < C if D is a face of C. Deﬁnition. A cell complex is a ﬁnite collection K of cells such that • If C ∈ K, and D < C, then D ∈ K. • If C, D ∈ K, then C ∩ D is a face of C and D. The underlying polyhedron, |K | is the union of all cells in K. A cellular map f : K → L is a PL map | f | : |K | → | L| which is linear on cells of K, and sends cells to cells. Deﬁnition. A cell complex L is a subdivision of K if | L| = |K | and each cell of L is contained in a cell K. We write L ▹ K if L is a subdivision of K.

Simplicial complexes
Our original notion of simplicial complex should now be called an abstract simplicial complex, to emphasize the fact that we originally did not place our simplexes in R n . In an abstract simplicial complex, only the relationship between the vertices and the faces is recorded. Deﬁnition. A cell complex is a simplicial complex if each C ∈ K is a simplex (i.e., an n-cell which is the join of n + 1 independent points). A triangulation of a polyhedron P is a simplicial complex K with a PL homeomorphism f : |K | → P. Deﬁnition. Suppose L ⊂ K are simplicial complexes. Deﬁne f : K → [0, 1] on vertices by { 0 if v ∈ L f (v) = 1 if v ̸∈ L and extending linearly to simplexes. If L = f −1 (0) we say L is a full subcomplex of K, and write L K.
