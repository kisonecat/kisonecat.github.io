Math 133 Section 22 Due Wednesday, May 31
Problem 1. (5 points). In this problem, we will develop an explicit formula for the sequence a0 = 1, a1 = 1, an+2 = an+1 + an , namely, the Fibonacci sequence. We work in a few steps:

Problem 2. (3 points). Find a Taylor series expansion for f (x) = x2 + 3x + 1 around the point a = 2. Problem √ (3 points). Find the ﬁrst three terms of the Taylor series expansion for 3. √ f (x) = 3 x around the point a = 1. Use this to approximate 3 1.1. Problem 4. (2 points). Use the ﬁrst three nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for sin x to approximate sin 1. Problem 5. (2 points). Use the Maclaurin series expansion for f (x) = ex to compute f (100) (0).
