\maketitle



As they say, \textit{mathematics is not a spectator sport.}  Stay involved by doing the homework.  Have fun trying to craft your own problems for fun!  If you encounter any troubles, please attend office hours.





\subsection*{Show your work}
When you ``solve'' a problem, the goal is not merely to give a correct answer!  Each problem has a story, and you should \textit{tell the story} by clearly explaining your argument.


\subsection*{The seven boxed problems will be graded}
Even if you don't do all the assigned problems (though you should!), the seven boxed problems will be graded.
