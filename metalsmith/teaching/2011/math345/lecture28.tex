\section*{functions}

not a rule, not an algorithm.  when are two functions the same?

domain

range (the textbook uses range for what I would call image, so let's go with ``codomain'')

\section*{examples}

identity function

function with empty domain

constant function

\section*{composition}

\section*{functions as input to other functions?}

the power set of $X$ as the collection of functions $X \to 2$.
