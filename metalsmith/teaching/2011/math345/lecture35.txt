Textbook
This lecture discusses section 15 of the textbook.

Homework

Write A ≈ B if there exists a bijection from A to B. show that [a, b] ≈ [0, 1].

Diagonalization
a triumph of humanity! there is no bijection from N to R. (there is no bijection from N to P(N).) produce an irrational number by listing rationals, and exhibiting a number not on the list. produce a transcendental number by listing algebraic numbers, and exhibiting a number not on the list.

CH
CH is the ﬁrst of Hilbert’s twenty-three problems presented in the year 1900.
