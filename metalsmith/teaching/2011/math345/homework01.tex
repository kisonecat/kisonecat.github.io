\subsection*{Feel free to do additional problems}
The listed homework is a \textit{lower bound} on the number of
problems you should be doing: doing more homework is a great idea!  It
is also a good idea to do more than just the problems from the book:
try your hand at inventing your own problems!  Try to push the limits
of the techniques we learn.  See what you can do with the mathematical
machinery.



\subsection*{Textbook}
Be sure to use \textit{The Fundamentals of Higher Mathematics} by Neil Falkner, Autumn 2010 edition; other editions will number the problems differently.
