A message from Professor Falkner
Dear Math 345 Student, Are you currently majoring in mathematics? If not, are you considering it? If you answered yes to either question, then I would like you to know about an opportunity to get acquainted with a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics whom you might eventually decide you would like to have as your advisor for your major program. A number of mathematics professors are oﬀering to meet this quarter with up to ﬁve students each to lead a ﬁve-session series of mathematics-related activities. Each of the professors has proposed a diﬀerent series of activities that they hope will interest students. I strongly encourage you to participate in one of these activities that interests you if your schedule permits it.

an impassioned plea to major in mathematics humorous example
n2 + n + 41 is a prime for each n ∈ N? try n = 41.

there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers
also, there are inﬁnitely many composite numbers! :-) 1

Solving congruences? quadratic polynomials
Let a, b ∈ Z. Suppose x2 + ax + b = 0 and x ∈ Q. What can we say about x?

third degree polynomials
Let r, s, t ∈ Z. Suppose x3 = rx2 + sx + t. Show that if x is rational, x is an integer.
