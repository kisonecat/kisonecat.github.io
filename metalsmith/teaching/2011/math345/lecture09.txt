This lecture discusses section 4 of the textbook.

Homework
The homework is due Monday, October 11, 2010. From Section 4 of the textbook, do exercises 1 and 2.

number theory
number theory: study the properties of whole numbers e.g., prime numbers

easy-to-state questions remain open
perfect numbers
6=1+2+3 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 8128 is perfect, too. 47 such numbers are known today. inﬁnitely many perfect numbers? unknown. any odd perfect numbers? unknown. it is known that such a number must have more than 300 digits. Descartes writes in 1638 1 I think I am able to prove that there are no even numbers which are perfect apart from those of Euclid; and that there are no odd perfect numbers, unless they are composed of a single prime number, multiplied by a square whose root is composed of several other prime number. But I can see nothing which would prevent one from ﬁnding numbers of this sort.

collatz conjecture
unknown

deﬁnitions for today
x is even if there exists k ∈ Z so that x = 2k. x is odd if there exists k ∈ Z so that x = 2k + 1.

example: odd plus odd is even
what do we need to use? distributivity.

properties you are allowed to use
two operations (+ and ·) both associative, commutative, with identities. distributivity.

can you prove that an integer is either even or odd?
no? why not? a deeper reason: there are mathematical systems which satisfy all the properties we can use, but for which “even” and “odd” don’t make sense.
