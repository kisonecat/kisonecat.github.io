Taylor series, Fourier series
A Fourier series decomposes a 2π-periodic function f : S 1 → R into a trigonometric polynomial (i.e., a sum of sin(nx) and cos(nx)).

Taylor series, Fourier series
A Fourier series decomposes a 2π-periodic function f : S 1 → R into a trigonometric polynomial (i.e., a sum of sin(nx) and cos(nx)). Poisson’s integral formula gives a relationship between Taylor series and Fourier series.

Poisson’s integral formula gives a relationship between Taylor series and Fourier series. The Taylor series around the center of the disk expresses the boundary function as trigonometric polynomial.

Laurent series
A Laurent series is one of the form
∞

an z n .
n=−∞

The series is convergent if the parts consisting of nonnegative powers and negative powers are separately convergent.

A Laurent series is one of the form
∞

an z n .
n=−∞

The series is convergent if the parts consisting of nonnegative powers and negative powers are separately convergent. Convergence occurs in an annulus.
