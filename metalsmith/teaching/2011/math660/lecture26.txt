Congratulations

I should have the midterms graded by tomorrow. Your homework, however, might be a bit delayed (another faculty member is grading it—sorry).

Removable singularities

Think back to the theorems we proved for analytic functions with ﬁnitely many exceptional points.

Assuming limz→a (z − a)f (z) = 0, we could still make progress.

Suppose Ω is a region, and Ω = Ω − point. Suppose f is analytic in Ω There exists an analytic function in Ω extending f if and only if limz→a (z − a)f (z) = 0.

Suppose Ω is a region, and Ω = Ω − point. Suppose f is analytic in Ω There exists an analytic function in Ω extending f if and only if limz→a (z − a)f (z) = 0.

Such singularities are called removable

Since f (n) (a) = n!fn (a), we have proved

Theorem (Taylor’s theorem)
If f (z) is analytic in a region Ω a, we can write f (z) = f (a)+(z−a)f1 (a)+· · ·+(z−a)n−1 fn−1 (a)+(z−a)n fn for a function fn (z) analytic in Ω.

We can say more about fn (z).

We can say more about fn (z). Since fn (z) = 1 2πi fn (ζ)dζ ζ −z

C

we can substitute fn (ζ), which involves f (ζ) and many terms of the form dζ =0 (ζ − a)m (ζ − z) 1 2πi f (ζ) (ζ − a)n (ζ − z)

Zeroes and poles

Now we proceed to study the zeroes and poles of an analytic function.

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
Suppose f (n) (a) = 0 for all n.

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
Suppose f (n) (a) = 0 for all n. By Taylor’s theorem, f (z) = fn (z)(z − a)n for any n.

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
Suppose f (n) (a) = 0 for all n. By Taylor’s theorem, f (z) = fn (z)(z − a)n for any n.Since 1 f (ζ) fn (z) = 2πi C (ζ − a)n (ζ − z) We have that M |fn (z)| ≤ n−1 R (R − |z − a|)

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
Suppose f (n) (a) = 0 for all n. By Taylor’s theorem, f (z) = fn (z)(z − a)n for any n.Since 1 f (ζ) fn (z) = 2πi C (ζ − a)n (ζ − z) We have that M |fn (z)| ≤ n−1 R (R − |z − a|) but we can relate fn and f , so |f (z)| ≤ |z − a| R

and therefore f (z) = 0 inside of the circle C .

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
In fact, f (z) ≡ 0 in the entire region.

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
In fact, f (z) ≡ 0 in the entire region. E1 = set on which all derivatives vanish. E2 = set on which some derivative is nonzero.

Zeroes of inﬁnite order
In fact, f (z) ≡ 0 in the entire region. E1 = set on which all derivatives vanish. E2 = set on which some derivative is nonzero.

Both E1 and E2 are open. And E1 = ∅. So E1 = Ω because Ω is connected.

Order of zeroes

If f (n) (a) = 0 for n < h, then we say a is a zero of order h.

Order of zeroes

If f (n) (a) = 0 for n < h, then we say a is a zero of order h.

Theorem
There are no zeroes of inﬁnite order.

Zeroes are isolated
If a is a zero of order h, then write f (z) = (z − a)h fh (z) for fh analytic and fh (a) = 0.

Zeroes are isolated
If a is a zero of order h, then write f (z) = (z − a)h fh (z) for fh analytic and fh (a) = 0. But since fh is analytic, fh is continuous, so fh (z) = 0 if z is in a neighborhood of a.

Zeroes are isolated
If a is a zero of order h, then write f (z) = (z − a)h fh (z) for fh analytic and fh (a) = 0. But since fh is analytic, fh is continuous, so fh (z) = 0 if z is in a neighborhood of a. So f (z) has isolated zeroes.

Theorem
Suppose f and g are analytic functions. If f (z) = g (z) for z ∈ A ⊂ Ω, and A has an accumulation point in Ω, then f = g .

Theorem
Suppose f and g are analytic functions. If f (z) = g (z) for z ∈ A ⊂ Ω, and A has an accumulation point in Ω, then f = g .

Analytic functions are determined by their values on sets with an accumulation point.

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ).

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ). Then a is an isolated singularity of f .

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ). Then a is an isolated singularity of f . If limz→a f (z) = ∞, then we say that a is a pole of f (z); we can deﬁne the order of a pole by considering 1/f (z), which has a removable singularity at a.

If limz→a f (z) = ∞, then we say that a is a pole of f (z); we can deﬁne the order of a pole by considering 1/f (z), which has a removable singularity at a. Poles are isolated, because zeroes are.

Meromorphic functions
A function f which is analytic in Ω, except at points which are poles, is called meromorphic in Ω.

Meromorphic functions
A function f which is analytic in Ω, except at points which are poles, is called meromorphic in Ω. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide (by nonzero) meromorphic functions to get new meromorphic functions.

A function f which is analytic in Ω, except at points which are poles, is called meromorphic in Ω. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide (by nonzero) meromorphic functions to get new meromorphic functions. Think of a meromorphic function as a holomorphic function from Ω to S 2 , the Riemann sphere.
