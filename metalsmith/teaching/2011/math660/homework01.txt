Feel free to do additional problems
The listed homework is a lower bound on the number of problems you should be doing: doing more homework is a great idea! It is also a good idea to do more than just the problems from the book: try your hand at inventing your own problems! Try to push the limits of the techniques we learn. See what you can do with the mathematical machinery.

Show Work
When you “solve” a problem, the goal is not merely to give a correct answer! Each problem has a story, and you should tell the story by clearly explaining your argument.
