Schwarz’ theorem

The function PU (z) is harmonic in the interior of the disk B1 (0), and continuous on the closed disk (provided U is continuous).

Reﬂection principle

If u(z) is harmonic, then u(z) is harmonic.

Reﬂection principle

If u(z) is harmonic, then u(z) is harmonic.

If f (z) is analytic, then f (z) is analytic.

Reﬂection principle

If u(z) is harmonic, then u(z) is harmonic.

If f (z) is analytic, then f (z) is analytic.

Consider f (z) − f (z).

Then v has a harmonic extension to Ω which satisﬁes the symmetry relation v (z = −v (z). In the same situation, if v is the imaginary part of an analytic function f (z) in Ω+ , then f (z) has an analytic extension which satisﬁes f (z) = f (z).
