Homology

Replace integrals over arcs by integrals over chains.

What is a chain?

Cycles
If a chain is a sum of closed curves, we call it a cycle.

Deﬁne winding number of cycles.

Simply connected
A region in C is simply connected if its complement is connected.

Examples?

Theorem
A region Ω is simply connected if and only if n(γ, a) for all cycles in Ω and all points a ∈ Ω.

Homology
A cycle in a region Ω is homologous to zero inside Ω if n(γ, a) for all a ∈ Ω.

Homology
A cycle in a region Ω is homologous to zero inside Ω if n(γ, a) for all a ∈ Ω. We write [γ1 ] = [0] ∈ H1 (Ω).

Homology
A cycle in a region Ω is homologous to zero inside Ω if n(γ, a) for all a ∈ Ω. We write [γ1 ] = [0] ∈ H1 (Ω). We write [γ1 ] = [γ2 ] ∈ H1 (Ω) if [γ1 − γ2 ] = [0].

Cauchy’s theorem
Theorem
If f (z) is analytic in Ω, then f (z) dz = 0
γ

for every cycle γ which is homologus to zero in Ω.

Cauchy’s theorem
Theorem
If f (z) is analytic in Ω, then f (z) dz = 0
γ

for every cycle γ which is homologus to zero in Ω. In other words, if the property holds for 1/(z − a) with a ∈ Ω, then it holds for all analytic f .

By Cauchy’s theorem, there exists a single-valued analytic function F (z) so that F (z) = f (z).

By Cauchy’s theorem, there exists a single-valued analytic function F (z) so that F (z) = f (z). Then,

Corollary
If f (z) is analyic and nonzero in a simply connected region Ω, then it is possible to deﬁne single valued analytic branches of log f (z) and n f (z).
