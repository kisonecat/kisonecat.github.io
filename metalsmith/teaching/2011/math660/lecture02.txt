Stereographic projection
Consider S 2 = {(x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ R3 : Extend C to C ∪ {∞}. xi 2 = 1},

i

Deﬁne f : S 2 → C ∪ {∞} by

z = x + iy = f (x1 , x2 , x3 ) =

x1 + ix2 1 − x3

The points (0, 0, 1), (x, y , 0), and (x1 , x2 , x3 ) are collinear.

phic projection sends a point P on S 2 to the intersection of th with the plane.

Deﬁnition
lim f (x) = L if for all > 0, there exists δ > 0, such that |f (x) − L| < whenever |x − a| < δ. “Absolute value” makes sense in C.

Deﬁnition

f (x + h) − f (x) h→0 h Warning: h ∈ C. This has deep consequences. f (x) = lim

Theorem

Suppose f : C → R is complex diﬀerentiable. Then f ≡ 0.

Terminology
Deﬁnition
A complex diﬀerentiable function f is called analytic or holomorphic. If f : C → C and f is everywhere complex diﬀerentiable, we call it entire. Examples of entire functions include polynomials.

Cauchy-Riemann equations

If u, v are a harmonic functions (∆u = 0) and ∂u ∂v ∂u ∂v = and =− ∂x ∂y ∂y ∂x then v is called a conjugate harmonic function for u.

Finding the conjugate harmonic function
u(x, y ) = x 2 − y 2 is harmonic.

Finding the conjugate harmonic function
u(x, y ) = x 2 − y 2 is harmonic. v (x, y ) must satisfy ∂v ∂v = 2y and = 2x. ∂x ∂y So v (x, y ) = 2xy + C for some constant C .

Finding the conjugate harmonic function
u(x, y ) = x 2 − y 2 is harmonic. v (x, y ) must satisfy ∂v ∂v = 2y and = 2x. ∂x ∂y So v (x, y ) = 2xy + C for some constant C . Note that z 2 = u(x, y ) + i · 2xy .

Cauchy-Riemann equations

Theorem
If u(x, y ) and v (x, y ) have continuous ﬁrst partials, and u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then f (a + bi) = u(a, b) + i v (a, b) is analytic.

Cauchy-Riemann equations
Alternatively, the C-R equations can be written as ∂f =0 ∂z where z = x + iy and z = x − iy . In some sense, analytic functions are truly functions of z, and not of z.
