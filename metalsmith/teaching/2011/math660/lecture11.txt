Multi-valued functions

How to talk about

√

z? Or log z?

Conformal maps

z

z2

z3

cos z

ez

1/z

√

log z

z

z3

cos z

sin z

ez

1/z

log z

Proof that analytic functions are conformal

A converse?
∂f ∂f Suppose ∂x and ∂y are continuous. Set w (t) = f (z(t)), so

w (t) =

∂f ∂f x (t) + y (t) ∂x ∂y 1 ∂f ∂f 1 = −i z (t) + 2 ∂x ∂y 2

∂f ∂f +i ∂x ∂y

z (t).

If angles are preserved, 1 2 ∂f ∂f −i ∂x ∂y + 1 2 ∂f ∂f +i ∂x ∂y
∂f ∂x

z (t) . z (t)

has a constant argument, so

∂f + i ∂y = 0.

A converse?

What about if the change in scale is isotropic?

Riemann surfaces

We won’t go into these in any detail, but a bit of thinking about this will help.

Riemann surface for

√

z?

Riemann surface for

√

z 4 − 1?
