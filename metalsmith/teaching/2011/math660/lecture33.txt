This is Cauchy’s residue theorem for when there are ﬁnitely many singularities.

If there are inﬁnitely many singularities, still only ﬁnitely many have nonzero winding number with γ,

Wait, we do!

Consider f (z) = bk (z − a)−k + · · · b1 (z − a)−1 + ϕ(z), for ϕ analytic.

Consider f (z) = bk (z − a)−k + · · · b1 (z − a)−1 + ϕ(z), for ϕ analytic. Then Res f (z) = b1 .

Consider f (z) = bk (z − a)−k + · · · b1 (z − a)−1 + ϕ(z), for ϕ analytic. Then Res f (z) = b1 . z=a For simple poles, it is even easier: then Res f (z) = lim (z − a) · f (z).
