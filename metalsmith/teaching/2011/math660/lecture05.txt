Radius of convergence
For a power series an z n , there exists a number R, so that If |z| < R, the series converges absolutely. If ρ < R, then the series converges uniformly for |z| ≤ ρ. If |z| > R, the series diverges. If |z| < R, the series is an analytic function, and the derivative is the sum of the termwise derivatives with the same radius of convergence. Speciﬁcally, 1/R = limn→∞ sup
