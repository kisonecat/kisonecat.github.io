Single-valued branch

√ Deﬁne a single-valued branch of 1 − x 2 for any region Ω, so that ±1 are in the same component of C − Ω.

Harmonic functions

Harmonic functions

A function u : R2 → R is harmonic if u is continuous, with continuous seconds partial derivatives, and ∆u = ∂ 2u ∂ 2u + = 0. ∂x 2 ∂y 2

Example of harmonic functions

Example of harmonic functions

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v ,

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic,

Integrals of harmonic functions
If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic, and we can ﬁnd f dz.

If u is harmonic, with conjugate harmonic function v , then f (x, y ) = u(x, y ) + i v (x, y ) is analytic, and we can ﬁnd f dz. ∂u ∂u dx + dy . ∂y ∂x

dv = −

But in practice, there may be no conjugate harmonic function, so we take as a deﬁnition ∗du = − ∂u ∂u dx + dy . ∂y ∂x

And so

γ

∗du = 0 for cycles homologous to zero.

Simply connected regions

In a simply connected regions, γ ∗du = 0 for all cycles, so u has a single-valued conjugate function v .

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0

For every cycle γ homologous to zero, u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = 0
γ

Proof: If conjugate harmonic functions exist (e.g., in a simply connected region like a rectangle), then u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = u1 dv2 − u2 dv1 = u1 dv2 + v1 du2 − d(u2 v1 ) = (im(u1 + iv1 )(du2 + idv2 )) − d(u2 v1 ),

γ

Proof: If conjugate harmonic functions exist (e.g., in a simply connected region like a rectangle), then u1 ∗ du2 − u2 ∗ du1 = u1 dv2 − u2 dv1 = u1 dv2 + v1 du2 − d(u2 v1 ) = (im(u1 + iv1 )(du2 + idv2 )) − d(u2 v1 ), so the integral vanishes.
