\noindent\textbf{Foliations.}  Instead of a ``smoothly varying
vector'' (that is, a vector field0, we consider a ``smoothly varying subspace.''

\begin{problem}[Lee 19--3]

  Let $D \subset TM$ be a smooth distribution, and let $\mathcal D(M)
  \subset \mathcal T(M)$ denote the space of smooth global sections of
  $D$.  Show that $D$ is involutive if and only if $\mathcal D(M)$ is
  a Lie subalgebra of $\mathcal T(M)$

\begin{problem}[Lee 19--12]

Let $D$ be an involutive distribution on a smooth manifold $M$, and
let $N$ be a connected integral manifold of $D$.  If $N$ is a closed
subset of $M$, show that $N$ is a maximal connected integral manifold
and is therefore a leaf of the foliation determined by $D$.
