\begin{problem}[cf.~Hatcher page 260 problem 33]
  Show that if $M$ is a compact \textit{acyclic} $n$-manifold, then
  $\partial M$ is a homology $(n-1)$-sphere, that is, $H_i(\partial M)
  = H_i(S^{n-1})$ for all $i$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Hatcher page 260 problem 31]
  Show that if $M$ is a compact $R$-orientable $n$-manifold, then the
  boundary map $H_n(M,\partial MR) \to H_{n-1}(\partial M;R)$ sends a
  fundamental class for $(M,\partial M)$ to a fundamental class for
  $\partial M$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Does every closed orientable $2$-submanifold $N^2$ of a closed
  $3$-manifold $M^3$ divide it into two pieces?  That is, does $M^3 -
  N^2$ necessarily have two components?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Embedding real projective space]
  For which $n \geq 1$ does $\RP^n$ embed in $S^{n+1}$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Embedding complex projective space]
  For which $n \geq 1$ does $\CP^n$ embed in $S^{2n+1}$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Embedding a pair of circles]
  Consider embeddings of $S^1 \sqcup S^1$ in $S^3$.  Use
  \textbf{linking number} to distinguish between two such embeddings
  up to isotopy.
