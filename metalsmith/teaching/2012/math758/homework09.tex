This is the last problem set in the course.  The final examination
will be a take-home exam, distributed at the last lecture and due the
following Thursday.

\begin{problem}[Lens spaces]
  The cyclic group $\Z/m$ acts on the circle $S^1$ by rotation through
  an angle of $2\pi/m$, so $\Z/m$ acts on the $k$-fold join $S^1 \ast
  S^1 \ast \cdots \ast S^1$, which is a $(2k-1)$-sphere.  Let
  $L^{2k-1}$ be the quotient of $S^{2k-1}$ by this action of $\Z/m$,
  and compute (either using Poincar\'e duality or Bocksteins) the cup
  product structure in $H^\star(L;\Z/m)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Product of real projective space]
  Calculate $H^\star(\RP^\infty \times \RP^\infty;\Z)$ as a ring.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Hatcher exercise 4 page 310]
  Using the cup product structure in $H^\star(\SO(5);\Z)$, show that
  $\SO(5)$ is not homotopy equivalent to the product of any two CW
  complexes with nontrivial cohomology.
\end{problem}
