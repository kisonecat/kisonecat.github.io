(b) Use the squeezing theorem to prove that cos
n→∞

|sin n| + 6n log n n = 0.

lim

√ (c) This problem is useful if you are stranded and need to compute 2. Deﬁne a sequence by setting a1 = 2 and an+1 = an /2 + 1/an . Assuming that lim an = L for a positive real number L and that an = 0 for all n ∈ N, n→∞ √ prove that L = 2. Hint: compute lim (an /2 + 1/an ) in two diﬀerent n→∞ ways.

(d) As a mathematician you must do more than solve problems—you also need to create them! On a separate sheet of paper, deﬁne a convergent sequence with an “interesting” limit.
