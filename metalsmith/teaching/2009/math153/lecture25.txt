Lecture 25: Partial fractions
Math 153 Section 57 Monday November 24, 2008 Overview
Recall that the limit comparison test allows us to determine whether polynomial polynomial converges. These quotients of polynomials are called rational functions. Rational functions are maybe the “next simplest” class o f functions after polynomials (which we understand very well). Derivative of a rational function is a rational function, so we can take all the derivatives we would like—no problem! But to antidiﬀerentiate a rational function? For this, we use partial fractions. This is, in fact, how the computers do these integrals.

Theory
We can integrate polynomials. What are some rational functions we can integrate? 1 log(ax + b) dx = +C ax + b a or somewhat more generally, for n > 1, 1 1 (ax + b)−n+1 dx = · +C (ax + b)n a −n + 1 For quadratics: x2 or even x 1 dx = log x2 + b2 + C 2 +b 2

x−a 1 dx = log (x − a)2 + b2 + C 2 + b2 (x − a) 2 1

We can also do

1 1 dx = arctan 2 + b2 (x − a) b

x−a b

+C

We can also do these if the denominators are raised to a power (with more diﬃculty). These functions suﬃce to do all rational functions. But we need a machine for transforming the general rational function into something of this form. What would that be?

Enter partial fractions
[ “I would like to see a proof of such and such.” “How many alphabets are you familiar with?” ] The theorem. Let f (x) = p(x)/q(x), a ratio of polynomials. We can assume that q’s leading term has a 1 coeﬃcient. The fundamental theorem of algebra: factor denominator as
m n

q(x) = ·
i=1

(x − ai ) ·
i=1

(x2 + bi x + ci )ki

that is, into linear and quadratic terms. Then we can write f (x) as f (x) = p(x) = P (x) + q(x)
m ji

i=1 r=1

Air + (x − ai )r

i=1 r=1

Bir x + Cir (x2 + bi x + ci )r

This seems pretty awful. How can we ever hope to ﬁnd all these constants?

An example
Suppose C 1 A B + = + 2 (x − 2) 2 (x − 3) x − 3 (x − 3) x−2 The least clever (and most involved) way is to multiply through by the denominator: 1 = A(x − 2)(x − 3) + B(x − 2) + C(x − 3)2 This gives 1 = (A + C)x2 + (−5A + B − 6C)x + (6A − 2B + 9C) So A + C = 0, and −5A + B − 6C = 0, and 6A − 2B + 9C = 1. Solve the three equations in three unknowns (the resulting equations will always have a unique solution). Get A = −C. So 5C + B − 6C = 0, so B − C = 0, so B = C. Then, −6C − 2C + 9C = 1, so C = 1, and therefore A = −1 and B = 1. 2

Check!

1 −1 1 1 = + + 2 (x − 2) 2 (x − 3) x − 3 (x − 3) x−2

This is true. This lets us do the integral 1 dx (x − 3)2 (x − 2) because you can do −1 1 1 + + 2 x − 3 (x − 3) x−2 dx

So many problems
The problems involved here are many. You are not likely to see (x − 3)2 (x − 2). You are more likely to see x3 − 8x2 + 21x − 18 How are you supposed to solve the factorization problem?

A tool in our toolbox, not a rule for solving all problems!
It is silly for me to give you lists of rules.

A second example
f (x) = Do long division 4x2 − 8x + 16 4x2 − 8x + 16 =1+ f (x) = 1 + 3 x − 4x2 + 8x x(x2 − 4x + 8) 4x2 − 8x + 16 A Bx + C = + 2 2 − 4x + 8) x(x x x − 4x + 8 Multiply through by x(x2 − 4x + 8) to get 4x2 − 8x + 16 = A(x2 − 4x + 8) + (Bx + C)x So A = 2. So B = 2. And C = 0. Therefore, f (x) = 1 + 2 1 x + 2 x x − 4x + 8 x3 + 16 x3 − 4x2 + 8x

Some tricks
Multiply the partial fraction decomposition by (x − ai ) and take the limit x → ai . Then only the term Ai,1 survives, so Ai,1 = lim (x − ai )f (x)
x→ai

In the case of f (x) = this tells us that
x→2

1 (x − 3)2 (x − 2) 1 =1 (x − 3)2 (x − 2)

lim (x − 2) ·

but of course is useless for to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients on 1/(x − 3) and 1/(x − 3)2 . We can ﬁnd 1 =1 lim (x − 3)2 · x→3 (x − 3)2 (x − 2) to discover that the coeﬃcient on 1/(x − 3)2 is 1. Then we know that 1 A 1 1 + = + 2 (x − 2) 2 (x − 3) x − 2 (x − 3) x−3 We could plug in a value like x = 4 to ﬁnd: A 1 1 1 + = + 2 (4 − 2) 2 (4 − 3) 4 − 2 (4 − 3) 4−3 which becomes so A = −1. 1 1 1 A =− + 2 + 2 2 1 1

Underview
Some some tricks include: taking limits, and plugging in values.
