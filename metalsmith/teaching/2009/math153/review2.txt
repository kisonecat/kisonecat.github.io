The Second Midterm
• There will be 12 questions on the exam and it will last 50 minutes. • The ﬁrst question will ask you to explain what

an = L means (i.e., give a deﬁnition

of the limit of an inﬁnite series, by invoking partial sums). • The last question will be an extra credit problem, with some true/false questions. • I was very impressed with your performance on the ﬁrst midterm, and will be expecting greatness. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security.

• Determine whether a series converges absolutely; determine whether a series conditionally. • Given a function, write down the ﬁrst few terms of its Taylor series (around 0 or around another point a) • Given a function, write down its Taylor series. • Approximate an alternating series and estimate the error in your approximation. • Approximate a Taylor series and estimate the error in your approximation. • State Taylor’s theorem and Lagrange’s theorem. • Determine the interval on which a power series converges. • Diﬀerentiate and integrate a power series term-by-term.

• Determine whether a series converges by using – the nth term test, – the integral test, – comparison test, – limit comparison test, – p-series test, – geometric series test, – harmonic series test, – the root test, – the ratio test, – alternating series test. A wise student may infer that I am not likely to ask about the integral test, or the root test. • Provide statements of the preceeding tests.

You should not merely give the answer: you should give an explanation. For full credit, you must justify you argument. In particular, if you are claiming that a series converges, you must state which test you are applying.
