2 midterms (225 points each). The midterms are in class. The ﬁrst midterm is on Monday, October 20, at the beginning of week 4; the second midterm is on Monday, November 17, at the beginning of week 8. 1 ﬁnal exam (400 points). The ﬁnal exam will be held 4:00–6:00p.m. on Tuesday, December 9, 2008.

Department Policy on Final Exams
It is the policy of the Department of Mathematics that the following rules apply to ﬁnal exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses: 1. The ﬁnal exam must occur at the time and place designated on the College Final Exam Schedule. In particular, no ﬁnal examinations may be given during the tenth week of the quarter, except in the case of graduating seniors. 2. Any student who wishes to depart from the scheduled ﬁnal exam time for the course must receive permission from Paul Sally (oﬃce is Ryerson 350, phone is 2-7388, email is sally@math.uchicago.edu). Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the ﬁnal exam except in the cases of an Incomplete.

Rescheduling a Midterm
Contact Jim Fowler early in the quarter if you will not be able to take a midterm on the scheduled day; we likely can accomodate you, but we will need time to prepare.

Late Homework
You must stay caught up. It is tempting to fall behind, but diﬃcult to catch up again—this is true of all courses, but especially true of a course in mathematics. That said, I understand your schedules are very busy, so I will not penalize you for infrequently turning in work a day or two late. Do not make a habit of it!
