(a) Without using a calculator, estimate sin 2 to within 0.05.

(b) Without using a calculator, estimate cos 2 to within 0.05.

(c) Find a series representation for sin2 x. Hint: use a double-angle formula.

(d) The Taylor series for arctan is given by
∞

arctan x =
n=0

(−1)n x2n+1 2n + 1

and converges when |x| ≤ 1. Using the fact that arctan 1 = π/4, approximate π to within 0.5.

(e) Use Lagrange’s theorem to prove that
∞

cos x =
n=0

(−1)n x2n (2n)!

for all real x.
