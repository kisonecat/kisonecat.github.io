How to Find a Taylor Series
Given a smooth function f , we can always write down a Taylor series; there is no guarantee that the series converges to anything, let alone to the function. Given a smooth function f : R → R, its Taylor series (around 0) is ∞ f (n) (0) xn n! A common mistake is to use instead of Given a smooth function f : R → R, its Taylor series expanded around a is
∞ n=0

f (n) (x)

n=0 f (n) (0).

f (n) (a) (x − a)n n!

The most important example of this sort of Taylor series is

How to More Easily Find a Taylor Series
There are tricks: you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (!) power series. You can substitute one series into another.

Why to Find a Taylor Series
Taylor series are good for: Estimating values by cutting the series oﬀ after a few terms and bounding the remainder; Seeing a snapshot by looking at the ﬁrst few terms, you can get a sense of what the function is doing near zero; Proving facts about functions like cos(−x) = cos x, which follows from the fact that the Taylor series for cosine only includes even degree terms; Doing calculus because it is easy to diﬀerentiate and integrate term-by-term; Solving diﬀerential equations for which it is often easier to ﬁnd a Taylor series for a solution.
