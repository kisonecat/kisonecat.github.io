For every ǫ > 0, there exists K ∈ N, so that if n ≥ K, then |an − L| < ǫ.

Problem 2. (25 points).
A mathematician often gives a deﬁnition, and then provides an example of the deﬁnition in action. Part (i). Deﬁne what it means for a sequence an to be bounded. Part (ii). Give an example of sequences xn and yn so that neither xn nor yn is bounded, but the sequence zn = xn + yn is bounded.

Solution.
Part (i). A sequence an is bounded if there exists real numbers U and L so that for all natural numbers n, L ≤ an ≤ U. Part (ii). As one of inﬁnitely many posible examples, set xn = n and yn = −n. Then neither xn nor yn is bounded, but zn = 0 is bounded.

Problem 3. (25 points).
Provide an ǫ-K proof of the fact that lim 1 + n5 = 1. n→∞ n5

Solution.
√ √ Let ǫ > 0. Pick K, a natural number, larger than 1/ 5 ǫ. So if n ≥ K, then n > 1/ 5 ǫ. Rearranging, n ≥ K implies 1 < ǫ. n5 Further algebraic manipulation proves that n ≥ K implies 0< And therefore, if n ≥ K, then n5 1 + n5 1 + 5 −1 = −1<ǫ 5 n n n5 1 + n5 − 1 < ǫ. n5

Problem 4. (20 points).
Evaluate lim cos ((1/x)x ).
x→∞

Solution.
First note that limx→∞ (1/x)x = 0, by, say, squeezing: for large x, 0 ≤ (1/x)x ≤ 1/x but limx→∞ 1/x = 0, so limx→∞ (1/x)x = 0. Since cos is continuous,
x→∞

lim cos ((1/x)x ) = cos

x→∞

lim (1/x)x = cos 0 = 1 .

Problem 5. (20 points).
Evaluate lim sin cos2 cos3 sin4 cos5 sin6 cos7 sin8 x . x→∞ x

Solution.
Note that −1 sin (anything) 1 ≤ ≤ x x x But limx→∞ 1/x = 0 and limx→∞ −1/x = 0, so by squeezing,

An example of such a sequence is an = 1+ log 17 n

Since an is the indeterminate form 1∞ , we replace an with elog an to deduce

Problem 10. (25 points).

Does the series

Does the series

It does converge. We check convergence by comparison. Since 0 ≤ f (n) ≤ 1, we have 0≤ But

Does the series

Solution.
This series diverges by the n-th term test. I claim that lim 1 n

But this is a 00 indeterminate form, so we note that lim 1 n
1/n

but the exponent is a 0 · ∞ indeterminate form, so we transform it 1 · log n→∞ n lim 1 n = lim

which is an ∞/∞ indeterminate form, and we can apply l’Hˆpital to get o

And therefore,

so the series diverges by the n-th term test.

Problem 13. (25 points).
∞

Consider the power series

Solution.
This series converges provided x ∈ (−1, 1), and diverges otherwise. By the ratio test, the series converges absolutely provided lim (n + 1)3 xn+1 = |x| < 1. n 3 xn

Now we need only check the endpoints. If x = 1, then the series becomes

which diverges (again by the n-th term test).

Problem 14. (20 points).
Let f : R → R be the function

f (x) = (1 + sin x)2 .

Write down the the ﬁrst four terms (i.e., x0 through x3 ) of the Taylor series for f expanded around x = 0.

Solution.
We could diﬀerentiate f a few times to ﬁnd the Taylor series, but it is a bit faster just to plug in the ﬁrst few terms of sin x. That is, 2 f (x) = (1 + sin x)2 = 1 + x − x3 /6 + O(x5 ) which we expand out to get f (x) = 1 + 2x + x2 − x3 + O(x4 ). 3

This is the Bessel function. Part (i): You may assume that |J (3) (x)| ≤ 1. Use this fact and Lagrange’s theorem to ﬁnd an approximation of J(1/2) and estimate the error in your approximation. Part (ii): What is J 4 (0)?

Solution.
Part (i): By Taylor’s theorem, J(1/2) = 1 − 15 (1/2)2 + R2 (1/2) = + R2 (1/2) 4 16

But by Lagrange’s theorem, R2 (1/2) = J (3) (c)(1/2)3 /6 for some c ∈ [0, 1/2]. Since |J (3) (x)| ≤ 1, we can conclude 1 1 |R2 (1/2)| < 3 = 2 ·6 48 So J(1/2) ≈ 15/16 with error no worse than 1/48. In other words, J(1/2) ∈ (15/16 − 1/48, 15/16 + 1/48) = (22/24, 23/24). Indeed J(1/12) ≈ 22.5233 . . . /24. Part (ii): The coeﬃcient on x4 in the Taylor series for J(x) is (−1)2 J (4) (0) = 2! 2! 24 4! Therefore, J (4) (0) = 3 24 = . 2 · 2 · 16 8

Problem 17. (20 points).
Use the method of partial fractions to evaluate 1 dx. x (x − 1) Remember to show your work.

Solution.
We must ﬁnd real numbers A and B so that B 1 A + = . x x−1 x (x − 1) Multiply both sides by x (x − 1) to get A(x − 1) + B(x) = 1 dx = 1 dx x (x − 1)

and so A = −1, and A + B = 0, so B = 1. Thus,

1 −1 + x x−1 And so,

1 dx = − log x + log(x − 1) + C. x (x − 1)

Problem 18. (25 points).
Find a function f : R → R which satisﬁes x · f ′ (x) + f (x) = sin2 x cos3 x. Remember to show your work.

Solution.
Divide by x, to get the equivalent equation f ′ (x) + Since
1 x

f (x) sin2 x cos3 x = x x

dx = log x + C, so an integrating factor is elog x = x. Multiplying by the integrating factor gives d (x f (x)) = xf ′ (x) + f (x) = sin2 x cos3 x dx

Therefore, x f (x) = Exchange cos2 x for 1 − sin2 x to get x f (x) = sin2 x (1 − sin2 x) cos x dx = (sin2 x − sin4 x) cos x dx sin2 x cos3 x dx.

but now we can do a u-substitution (with u = sin x) to get x f (x) = and therefore, the general solution is f (x) = sin3 x sin5 x C − + . 3x 5x x sin3 x sin5 − +C 3 5
