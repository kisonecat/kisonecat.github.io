Polygons
Problem 1. Let P and Q be triangles having the same area; show that P can be cut into smaller triangles, which can be rearranged to form Q. Problem 2 (Bolyai-Gerwien Theorem). Let P and Q be polygons having the same area; show that P can be cut into smaller polygons, which can be rearranged to form Q. Remark. It is (surprisingly!) possible to partition B 2 = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : x2 + y 2 ≤ 1} into about 1050 subsets, translate (without rotations) these subsets, and form a square having the same area. This was proved by Mikl´s Laczkovich in 1990. o

Banach-Tarski Paradox
Deﬁnition 3. The free group on two generators, denoted F2 , consists of all words written using a, b, a−1 , b−1 where a never appears next to a−1 , and b never appears next to b−1 . We can multiply two words by concatenating them, and cancelling a’s with a−1 and b with b−1 ; the empty word is (ironically?) written e; multiplying a word w by e leaves w unchanged (so e is the identity). Problem 4. For every word w ∈ F2 , does there exist a word w ∈ F2 so that ww = e? Problem 5. For three words w1 , w2 , w3 ∈ F2 , is it the case that (w1 w2 )w3 = w1 (w2 w3 )? Remark. If you answered YES! to the previous two quesions, you have shown that F2 is a group—a set with an binary associative operation having an identity and inverses. Deﬁnition 6. The set S( ) consists of words in F2 starting with the letter . Problem 7. Show that F2 = {e} ∪ S(a) ∪ S(b) ∪ S(a−1 ) ∪ S(b−1 ).

· S = { · s : s ∈ S}. Problem 9. “Paradoxically” prove that F2 = a · S(a−1 ) ∪ S(a). Similarly, prove that F2 = b · S(b−1 ) ∪ S(b). Remark. Here we see the beginnings of a paradoxical decomposition: we have divided F2 into ﬁve sets, and using four of them, built two copies of F2 . If only there were a way to convert our paradoxical decomposition of F2 into a paradoxical decomposition of the sphere. . . Problem 10. Let A=

Both A and B are linear maps R3 → R3 . Are these linear maps invertible? Are they rotations? Problem 11. Any word in F2 can be rewritten as a product of the matrices A, B, A−1 , and B −1 ; that is, there is a function φ : F2 → Hom(R3 , R3 ). For which w ∈ F2 does it happen that φ(w) is the identity matrix? Deﬁnition 12. Write S 2 for the two-sphere, i.e., the set of points (x, y, z) ∈ R3 with x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1. Problem 13. The linear map A : R3 → R3 can be restricted to give a function A : S 2 → S 2 . The analogous statement holds for B, indeed, for any φ(w). This means that φ(w) can be regarded as function taking points on the sphere to other points on the sphere. Deﬁnition 14. Let D ⊂ S 2 consist of those points p ∈ S 2 for which there is some w ∈ F2 , with w = e but φ(w)(p) = p. These are the points ﬁxed by some element of F2 . Problem 15. D is countable. Hint: if p is ﬁxed by a rotation, then p is on the axis of the rotation; how many points on the sphere lie on a given axis of rotation? Deﬁnition 16. Points p, q ∈ S 2 − D are in the same orbit if there is some w ∈ F2 so that φ(w)(p) = q. Let R be a set containing a representative from each orbit. Problem 17. Every point in S 2 − D can be written uniquely as φ(w)(r) for some w ∈ F2 and some r ∈ R.

Show that S 2 − D = Ra ∪ Rb ∪ Ra−1 ∪ Rb−1 . Also show that S 2 − D = φ(a)(Ra−1 ) ∪ Ra . But also show that S 2 − D = φ(b)(Rb−1 ) ∪ Rb . Remark. We have decomposed S 2 − D into four pieces, thrown away two of the pieces, rotated one the remaining pieces by φ(a), and ended with S 2 − D. This is paradoxical. Next we will show that S 2 − D can be cut up and rearranged to get S 2 . Problem 19. Pick some point x ∈ S 2 with x ∈ D. Let J consist of the bad angles—angles θ so that rotation by nθ (for some n ∈ N) around axis x takes some point d ∈ D to some other point in D. Prove J is countable. Problem 20. Let θ be a good angle (i.e., not in J). Why does a good angle exist? Let G : R3 → R3 be rotation around the axis x ∈ S 2 through angle θ. Problem 21. Deﬁne Dn = G(G(G(· · · G(D), i.e., n applications of G to D. Prove that all the Dn are disjoint; let E = ∞ Dn . i=0 Problem 22. Show that G(E) = E − D. Problem 23. Show that S 2 can be cut into two pieces, S 2 − E and E, which can be rearranged to form S 2 − D. Remark. Altogether, we have shown that S 2 can be cut into two pieces, which can be rearranged to form S 2 − D. We earlier showed that S 2 − D can be cut into four pieces, which can be rearrnaged to make two copies of S 2 − D. But each of these copies of S 2 − D can be cut up, make two copies of S 2 . Remark. This decomposition did not even require translation! We take S 2 , throw away some pieces, and rotate the remaining pieces (perhaps through other pieces!) into new positions to reform S 2 . Problem 24. Let B 3 = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 : x2 + y 2 + z 2 ≤ 1}; this is the solid ball. Use the paradoxical decomposition of S 2 to build a paradoxical decomposition of B 3 − {(0, 0, 0)}. Hint: Extend radially. Problem 25. Use a trick (like the one we used to convert S 2 − D into S 2 ) and some translations to build a paradoxical decomposition of B 3 into two copies of B 3 .
