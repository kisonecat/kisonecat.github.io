reminder about limits deﬁne continuity partial derivatives

deﬁnition notation example: f (x, y) = a polynomial. geometry: slopes of tangent lines higher partials commutativity of higher partials: true when the higher partials are continuous.

5

diﬀerentiability

tangent plane if partials exist and are continuous, then diﬀerentiable example: xy/(x2 + y 2 ). consider the approach along the x and y axis.
