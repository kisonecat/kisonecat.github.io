I've been (not surprisingly) drinking quite a bit of coffee lately, and I've noticed that many corregated coffee cup holders include a bit of loose glue.  At first, I thought this was a mistake, an oversight in the perfection of the coffee cup holder design.

On the contrary, that bit of excess glue melts when the hot coffee is poured into the cup, adhering the corregated holder to the cup--brilliant!
