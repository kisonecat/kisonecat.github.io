<p>In this fun paper,
<blockquote>MR1845679</blockquote>
it is pointed out that
<ul>
	<li><b>homology</b> is a very basic invariant, and</li>
	<li><b>closed manifolds</b> are very basic objects</li>
</ul>
and so a very basic question is: what sequences of abelian groups are the homology groups of a closed simply connected manifold?
</p>

<p>
It isn't very hard to realize any sequence of abelian groups <b>up to the middle dimension</b>, but that middle dimension is tricky (e.g., classify $(n-1)$-connected $2n$-manifolds).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I was wondering: is this realization question solvable for homology with coefficients in $\Z/2\Z$ or $\Q$?
