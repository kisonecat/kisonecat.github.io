  <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> plots the search volume (or some other measure?  search percentage?) for a given phrase over time.  It's ridiculously fun!

As an example, let's look at the number of times people search for the words <b>hot</b> and <b>cold</b>.  I downloaded the <a href='google-global-warming.csv' title='Google Global Warming Data'>CSV file</a> offered by Google trends to make the following graph:

<%= image( "google-global-warming.png" ) %>

The thick red and blue lines are the linear regressions on the number of searches for <b>hot</b> and <b>cold</b>, respectively.  Behold!&mdash;people are searching <i>more often</i> for <b>hot</b> lately, and <i>less often</i> as of late for <b>cold</b>!  The search volume does seem to be related to the temperature: you might notice that the search volume for <b>cold</b> dips under the regression line during the summer, but exceeds it during the winter.

And so, <b>global warming is being revealed in our search habits.</b>  Maybe I should've titled this post "Google warming."
