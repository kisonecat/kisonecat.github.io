  The <a href="http://kisonecat.com/2006/10/07/pineapple-sauce-pancakes/">pineapple sauce pancake</a> graph has English words as vertices, and a directed edge from $a$ to $b$ if the concatenation $ab$ is also an English word.  For instance, there is a vertex labeled <b>pine</b>, and a vertex labeled <b>apple</b>, and an edge from <b>pine</b> to <b>apple</b>.

Anyway, the graph is huge; and the usual visualization tool (<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>) doesn't work particularly well on the whole graph, so I took a few hundred vertices around pine, apple, sauce, pan, and cake.  The result was the following:
