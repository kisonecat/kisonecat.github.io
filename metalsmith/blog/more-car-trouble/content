This morning I went to the car to see if I could start it, and at least move it back and forth a bit (as I still don't have my license).  Fortunately, the car started!  Unfortunately, the clutch doesn't seem to do anything.

I am holding down the clutch while the car starts, but then I can't shift into reverse: all I hear is gear-grinding.  I can't shift into first at all; the knob won't even move there.  With the car off, I shifted into reverse, and then started the car (okay okay, I realize now this was a truly stupid idea), but it merely lurched backward before the engine died.  It's just as if I let up on the clutch too quickly without enough gas...

I guess the clutch isn't doing anythnig at all.

This must be a consequence of my having not driven it while I was away; the emergency brake is sort of loose feeling, the door locks are sticking, and, rather tellingly, the clutch sort of squeaks when I move it.  I guess this means I will have it towed away again to be repaired again; at least the people at the transmission shop are very nice.

I really just want to learn how to drive.  Someday, someday.
