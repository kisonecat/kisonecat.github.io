p Given a bounding class ${\mathcal B}$, we construct a bounded refinement ${\mathcal{B}K}(-)$ of Quillen's $K$-theory functor from rings to spaces. As defined, ${\mathcal{B}K}(-)$ is a functor from weighted rings to spaces, and is equipped with a comparison map $BK \to K$ induced by &ldquo;forgetting control.&rdquo; In contrast to the situation with $\mathcal{B}$-bounded cohomology, there is a functorial splitting ${\mathcal{B}K}(-) \simeq K(-) \times {\mathcal{B}K}^{rel}(-)$ where ${\mathcal{B}K}^{rel}(-)$ is the homotopy fiber of the comparison map.
