The belief that all simple (having no continuous moduli) objects in the nature are controlled by the Coxeter groups is a kind of religion. —V.I. Arnold, First steps of local contact algebra.

Root systems

Unfortunately, I again deﬁne root system without much motivation. Nonetheless, I hope you will be surprised to discover how restrictive the deﬁnition of root system is—there are four inﬁnite families, and ﬁve “exceptional” root systems that just don’t belong. Deﬁnition 1.1 (Hyperplanes and reﬂections). Let V be a vector space with inner product, and v ∈ V a vector. Then the hyperplane normal to v is Hv := {w ∈ V : w, v = 0}. The reﬂection through the hyperplane Hv is the linear map sv : V → V deﬁned by sv (w) = w − 2 Exercise 1.2. Check that sv 2 is the identity. Deﬁnition 1.3 (Root system.). Let V be a vector space. A root system is subset Φ ⊂ V satisfying: • The set Φ is ﬁnite. • The span of Φ is V . • If v ∈ Ω, then sv (Φ) = Φ. • If v ∈ Φ, then Φ ∩ v, w v. v, v

Rv = {v, −v}.

The elements of a root system are called roots. Deﬁnition 1.4 (Isomorphism). Two root systems Φ ⊂ V and Φ ⊂ V are isomoprhic if there is an isometry f : V → V with f (Φ) = Φ . 1

Root Systems and Coxeter Groups

Deﬁnition 1.5 (Direct sums). Let Φ and Φ be root systems in V and V , respectively. Then Φ ⊕ Φ is a root system in the vector space V ⊕ V . A root system Φ is reducible if it can be written as such an (orthogonal) direct sum, and irreducible otherwise. Exercise 1.6. For a vector space V with orthogonal basis {ei }, the set {±ei } is a root system. This is a reducible root system.

Deﬁnition 1.7 (Crystallographic root system.). A root system Φ is crystallographic if, for all v, w ∈ Φ, we have v, w 2 ∈ . v, v

Z

Exercise 1.8. Play around with this crystallographic condition; what are the possible angles between v, w ∈ Φ when Φ is crystallographic? Remark 1.9. A Coxeter group does not in general have a crystallographic root system; but the groups that we will be working with in the classiﬁcation of Lie groups are all crystallographic, so we might as well simplify our work by considering only the special sort of Coxeter group arising here. Exercise 1.10. Find four non-isomorphic crystallographic root systems in

R2.

Weyl Groups

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Weyl group.). Let Φ ⊂ V be a root system. Then the Weyl group of Φ is the group generated by sv : V → V for all v ∈ Φ. Exercise 2.2. Is the Weyl group well-deﬁned (i.e., do isomorphic root systems give isomorphic Weyl groups?). Exercise 2.3. Is the Weyl group ﬁnite? Exercise 2.4. What are the Weyl groups of the four crystallographic root systems in

R2?

Exercise 2.5. Find a root system having the symmetric group on four letters, S4 , as its Weyl group.

Positive systems
Φ+ (w) := {v ∈ Φ : v, w > 0}.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Positive system). Let Φ ⊂ V be a root system, and choose w ∈ V . Deﬁne

We say that w is regular if Φ = ±Φ+ (w), and singular otherwise. If w is regular, we call Φ+ (w) a positive system for Φ. 2

Deﬁnition 3.3 (Decomposing roots). Let Φ+ be a positive system for a root system Φ. Then v ∈ Φ+ is decomposable if it is the sum of two other roots in Φ+ , and indecomposable otherwise.

Simple systems

Deﬁnition 4.1 (Positive cone). Given vectors v1 , . . . , vn ∈ V , the positive cone of {v1 , . . . , vn } are the nonnegative linear combinations of the vi . Deﬁnition 4.2 (Simple systems). Let Φ+ be a positive system for a root system Φ. A simple system Π for Φ+ is a minimal subset of Φ+ generating the same positive cone as Φ+ . The elements of a simple system are called simple roots. This deﬁnition of simple system depends on a choice of positive system, but we can also deﬁne simple systems intrinsically—a simple system Π is a subset of Φ spanning V , so that every root is a non-positive or a non-negative linear combination of roots in Π. Exercise 4.3. Let Φ+ be a positive system for a root system Φ. Show that the indecomposable roots form a simple system. Exercise 4.4. Consider a simple system Π for a root system Φ ⊂ V . Then the span of Π is V , so maps between simple systems determine maps between vector spaces (and it will therefore be enough to classify simple systems). Deﬁnition 4.5 (Weyl chambers). Let Φ ⊂ V be a root system. The connected components of V − v∈Φ Hv are the Weyl chambers of Φ. Exercise 4.6. There is a bijection between Weyl chambers of Φ and positive systems, and between positive systems and simple systems. In fact, the Weyl group acts transitively on positive systems and simple systems. There’s a lot more to say about the action of the Weyl group on the positive systems, but that is for another day.

Reducibility

Exercise 5.1. Give examples of reducible and irreducible root systems. Exercise 5.2. A simple system Π for a root system Φ is reducible if and only if Φ is reducible. 3

This is only one way to deﬁne a positive system (it makes clearer the relationship between positive systems and Weyl chambers, deﬁned later). Alternatively, we can say that a positive system is any subset Φ+ ⊂ Φ so that Φ is the disjoint union of Φ+ and −Φ+ , and so that Φ+ is closed under sums.

Exercise 6.2. What are the four possible values of Aij in the special case of a crystallographic root system? Exercise 6.3. What are the Cartan matrices for the root systems in Exercise 6.4. The Cartan matrix determines Φ up to isomorphism. Exercise 6.5. What does the Cartan matrix for a reducible root system look like?

Coxeter graph

Deﬁnition 7.1 (Coxeter graph). Given a Cartan matrix A for a simple system Π = {ai }, its associated Coxeter graph has a vertex for each simple root, and a Aij Aji edges between roots ai and aj . Exercise 7.2. Draw the Coxeter graphs for your favorite root systems. Does the Coxeter graph determine the root system? Deﬁnition 7.3 (Dynkin Diagram). Given a Cartan matrix A for a simple system Π = {ai }, its associated Dynkin diagram is its Coxeter graph, decorated with an arrow on double and triple edges, drawn from ai to aj whenever ai is longer than aj . Exercise 7.4. What does the Coxeter graph for a reducible root system look like? Does the Dynkin diagram determine the root system? Hint: does the Dynkin diagram determine the Cartan matrix?

Summarizing the situation

From root systems, we produced positive systems, which gave rise to simple systems, which allowed us to deﬁne the Cartan matrix, and ﬁnally, the Coxeter graph—which doesn’t quite determine the root system—and the Dynkin diagram—which does determine the root system. Consider a ﬁnite undirected graph Γ = (V, E). Let V = {v1 , . . . , vn }, and deﬁne cij to be the number of edges connecting vi and vj . On the real vector space spanned by the vertices √ of V , deﬁne a bilinear form (which we call the adjacency form) by b(vi , vj ) = − cij . Deﬁnition 8.1 (Positive graphs). A graph Γ = (V, E) is positive if the adjacency form b is positive deﬁnite. Exercise 8.2. A Coxeter graph is a positive graph. 4

Deﬁnition 9.1 (Subgraph). Given a graph Γ = (V, E), a graph Γ = (V , E ) is a subgraph of Γ, written Γ ⊂ Γ, if V ⊂ V and E ⊂ E. Exercise 9.2. A subgraph of a positive graph is positive.

Exercise 9.3. Check that the Coxeter graphs Ai , Bi , Di , E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , and G2 are all positive graphs. Exercise 9.4. Find a family P of “poisonous” graphs so that • No Γ ∈ P is positive. • If Γ is any non-positive connected graph, then there exists Γ ⊂ Γ with Γ ∈ P . Having ﬁnished this exercise, you will have shown that every positive graph is one of the Coxeter graphs we know about. Exercise 9.5. Decorate your Coxeter graphs to ﬁnd the possible Dynkin diagrams. Exercise 9.6. Find root systems having each of the possible Dynkin diagrams.
