ﬁbonacci numbers
every third ﬁbonnaci number is odd. more generally, every k-th number is a multiple of Fk periodic mod n. every number can be written as a sum of ﬁbonacci numbers, using each number at most once Fk is the number of sequences of 1s and 2s that add up to k − 1. F2n = Fn+1 2 − Fn−1 2 . Fibonacci primes with thousands of digits have been found, but it is not known whether there are inﬁnitely many. 144 is the only nontrivial square Fibonacci number.

connection to pascal’s triangle?

calculus of ﬁnite diﬀerences
a dictionary for translating calculus to sums and back again. e.g., how to compute n k 2 via the calculus of ﬁnite diﬀerences. k=0
