Textbook
This lecture discusses section 2 of the textbook.

Homework
The homework is due Thursday, September 30, 2010. From Section 2 of the textbook, do exercises 19 and 20. We did this example last time in class, so it shouldn’t be too hard.

contradiction
what is a contradiction? Q ∧ ¬Q

Why does this work?
look at a truth table

how to prove a negative statement
proof by contradiction example: ((P ⇒ Q) ∧ ¬Q) ⇒ ¬P .

Versus contrapositive
Want to prove P ⇒ Q? Method of Contradiction: Assume P and Not Q and prove some sort of contradiction. Method of Contrapositive: Assume Not Q and prove Not P.

example from textbook
if x2 is even, then x is even.

example: diophantine equation
There are no positive integer solutions to the diophantine equation x2 − y 2 = 1 proof: factoring

example: largest number
theorem: there is no largest integer

last digit of squares
If n is a perfect square, then n ends with a 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.

Ramsey theory
There are six people at a party. At least 3 know each other, or 3 don’t.
