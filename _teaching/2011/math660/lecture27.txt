Theorem
Suppose f and g are analytic functions. If f (z) = g (z) for z ∈ A ⊂ Ω, and A has an accumulation point in Ω, then f = g .

Theorem
Suppose f and g are analytic functions. If f (z) = g (z) for z ∈ A ⊂ Ω, and A has an accumulation point in Ω, then f = g .

Analytic functions are determined by their values on sets with an accumulation point.

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ).

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ). Then a is an isolated singularity of f .

Singularities
Suppose f (z) is analytic in a neighborhood of a, but perhaps not at a. (I.e., analytic in a region 0 < |z − a| < δ). Then a is an isolated singularity of f . If limz→a f (z) = ∞, then we say that a is a pole of f (z); we can deﬁne the order of a pole by considering 1/f (z), which has a removable singularity at a.

If limz→a f (z) = ∞, then we say that a is a pole of f (z); we can deﬁne the order of a pole by considering 1/f (z), which has a removable singularity at a. Poles are isolated, because zeroes are.

Meromorphic functions

A function f which is analytic in Ω, except at points which are poles, is called meromorphic in Ω.

Meromorphic functions

A function f which is analytic in Ω, except at points which are poles, is called meromorphic in Ω.

Add, subtract, multiply, and divide (by nonzero) meromorphic functions to get new meromorphic functions.

Think of a meromorphic function as a holomorphic function from Ω to S 2 , the Riemann sphere.

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α,

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a larger value,

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a larger value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a larger value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity,

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a larger value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity, so either f (z) ≡ 0 or (z − a)m f (z) has a zero of order k.

Singularities
If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a larger value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity, so either f (z) ≡ 0 or (z − a)m f (z) has a zero of order k.

So for all α > m − k, the limit vanishes, and if α < m − k, the limit equals inﬁnity.

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α,

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a smaller value,

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a smaller value, so the same is true for α = integer.

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a smaller value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity,

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a smaller value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity, and (z − a)m f (z) has a pole of order ell.

If limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ for some α, then the same is true for α replaced by a smaller value, so the same is true for α = integer.

Then (z − a)m f (z) has a removable singularity, and (z − a)m f (z) has a pole of order ell.

So for all α < m + , the limit equals inﬁnity, and if α > m + , the limit vanishes.

Summarizing

So either f (z) ≡ 0, or there is some h so that if α > h, then limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = 0 if α < h, then limz→a |z − a|α |f (z)| = ∞ or maybe neither limit holds for any α.

Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer.

Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer. Apply Taylor’s theorem to (z − a)h f (z), to ﬁnd (z −a)h f (z) = Bh +Bh−1 (z −a)+· · ·+B1 (z −a)h−1 +ϕ(z)(z −a)h with ϕ(z) analytic at z = a.

Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer. Apply Taylor’s theorem to (z − a)h f (z), to ﬁnd (z −a)h f (z) = Bh +Bh−1 (z −a)+· · ·+B1 (z −a)h−1 +ϕ(z)(z −a)h with ϕ(z) analytic at z = a. Divide both sides by (z − a)h , to get f (z) = Bh Bh−1 + + · · · + ϕ(z) h (z − a) (z − a)h−1

The part before ϕ(z) is the singular part of f .

Algebraic order
in the second case, the cut-oﬀ α is an integer. Apply Taylor’s theorem to (z − a)h f (z), to ﬁnd (z −a)h f (z) = Bh +Bh−1 (z −a)+· · ·+B1 (z −a)h−1 +ϕ(z)(z −a)h with ϕ(z) analytic at z = a. Divide both sides by (z − a)h , to get f (z) = Bh Bh−1 + + · · · + ϕ(z) h (z − a) (z − a)h−1

The part before ϕ(z) is the singular part of f . A pole comes with a well-deﬁned singular part, and if you subtract oﬀ the singular part, you are left with an analytic function.

Essential singularity

If there is no such α satisfying those limits, then we say it is an essential singularity.

Theorem
An analytic function comes arbitrarily close to every complex value in a neighborhood of an essential singularity.
