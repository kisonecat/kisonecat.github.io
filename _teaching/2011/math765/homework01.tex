The following represents a \textit{lower bound} on the number of
exercises you should be doing; the textbook is full of great
exercises, so I encourage you to do as many as possible.
\textit{The exercises below should be handed in on Monday, January 10, 2011.}

\begin{problem}
  For each of the following topological spaces, determine whether or
  not they can be given the structure of a smooth manifold, and, if so,
  explain how.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The disjoint union of uncountably many copies of $\R$,
\item Two copies of $\R$ with all non-zero points identified (I mean,
  $x$ in the first copy is identified witih $x$ in the second
  copy---in other words, the ``line with two origins'').
\item $\RP^n$,
\item $\CP^n$,
\item $T^n = \overbrace{S^1 \times \cdots \times
    S^1}^{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Lee 2--10]
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Show that the quotient map $\pi : \CC^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to
    \CP^n$ is smooth.
  \item Show that $\CP^1$ is diffeomorphic to $S^2$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}
  For every pair of positive integers $n$ and $m$, find infinitely
  many distinct nonconstant smooth maps from $\CP^n$ to $\CP^m$.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Lee 2-11]
  Let $G$ be a connected Lie group, and let $U \subset G$ be any
  neighborhood of the identity.  Show that every $g \in G$ can be
  written as a finite product of elements of $U$.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Lee 3--1]
  Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with $M$ connected, and $F
  : M \to N$ is a smooth map such that $F_\star : T_p M \to T_{F(p)}
  N$ is the zero map for each $p \in M$.  Show that $F$ is a constant
  map.
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Lee 3--3]
  If a nonempty smooth $n$-manifold is diffeomorphic to an
  $m$-manifold, prove that $n = m$.
\end{problem}
