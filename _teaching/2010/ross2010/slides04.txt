Link
Deﬁnition
Let K be a complex, and σ ∈ K a simplex. The link of σ ∈ K , written lk(σ, K ), consists of those simplexes in K which are in cl(st(σ, K )) but not touching σ; in other words, lk(σ, K ) = {τ ∈ cl(st(σ, K )) : τ ∩ σ = ∅}. Warning for myself The other deﬁnition also appears in the literature.

Stellar Subdivision
Deﬁnition
Let K be a complex, and σ ∈ K a simplex. The stellar subdivision of K at σ is a new complex Kσ with: the vertices of K with a new vertex v . the simplexes of K not in st(σ, K ), along with the simplexes in v ∗ (∂σ) ∗ lk(σ, K ). We might say: Kσ := (K − st(σ, K )) ∪ (v ∗ (∂σ) ∗ lk(σ, K ))

Homeomorphisms
Problem 5. Is PL homeomorphism an equivalence relation? That is, is it: reﬂexive, meaning, is A homeomorphic to A, symmetric, meaning, if A ∼ B, is it true that B ∼ A, and = = transitive, meaning, if A ∼ B and B ∼ C, is it true that A ∼ C? = = =

Let Xn be the disjoint union of n circles (e.g., X3 = S1 ∪ S1 ∪ S1 ). For this problem, call two maps f , g : Xn → S2 “equivalent” if there exists a homeomorphism h : S2 → S2 so that h ◦ f = g.

SPHERES IN FIVE DIMENSIONS
BY E. C. ZEEMAN

Communicated by S. Eilenberg, December 26, 1959

Given a semi-linear embedding of 5 2 in euclidean S-space, we show that it is unknotted. Join it up to a vertex V in general position. If the cone VS2 is nonsingular we are finished. Otherwise, for dimensional reasons, there are at most a finite number of singularities, where just two points of S2 are collinear with V. Let's have V away on one side, so that at each singularity we can call one point "near" and the other point "far." Now separate the near and far points by an equator S 1 , so that all the near points lie in the northern hemisphere A, and all the far points lie in the southern hemisphere B. Let S2 be the sphere VS^-VJB. Then S2 is equivalent to 5 2 , because they differ by the boundary of the ball VA, whose interior does not meet them. But S2 is unknotted because it bounds, and does not meet the interior of, the ball VB. Hence S2 is unknotted. n REMARK 1. The argument generalizes to unknotting S in &-space,
