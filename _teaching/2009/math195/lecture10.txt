Extrema

deﬁne global min, global max deﬁne local min, local max theorem re continuous image of closed, bounded sets. example: f (x, y) = x2 + y 2 . if local extrema, then derivative vanishes critical point: partials vanish, or partial dne. second derivative test procedure: ﬁnd critical points, ﬁnd boundary extrema, ﬁnd largest and smallest.

2

Lagrange multipliers

ﬁnd extrema with a constraint intuitive argument: curves on constraint classic problem: biggest box (without a lid) with 12 square units of cardboard.
