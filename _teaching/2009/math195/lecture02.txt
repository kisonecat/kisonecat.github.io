Lecture 2: Coordinate systems
Math 195 Section 91 Wednesday June 24, 2009
Goal: section 11.3 and 13.1 and 13.2. What is a “coordinate system”? why are these important? the greatness of analytic geometry!

0.1

Polar coordinates

Examples of polar coordinates x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ converting back and forth. same point may have many names. graphing polar equations r = f (θ). it helps to graph the function in cartesian coordinates ﬁrst! example: r = 17. example: r = 2 cos θ and then rearrange to ﬁnd that this is a circle example: r = 1 + sin θ cardioid example: r = cos(2θ) four-petaled rose

0.2

Calculus in polar coordinates

ﬁnd slopes of tangent lines dy/dx. same trick as in parametric case.

0.3

Three dimensional systems

three coordinates! draw some pictures draw the xz, xy, and yz planes. draw all the points where an equation holds: z = 3, y = 3, x = 3, x = y, x2 + y 2 = 4. x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1. this reminds me about the distance formula! equation of a sphere with center (a, b, c) and radius r. complete-the-square to transform complicated looking equations into the equation for a sphere. doing calculus in this situation—it will be coming later. 1

Vectors

a “vector” means diﬀerent things: a tuple of numbers, a direction with a magn itude, an arrow, a. . . add vectors with triangles (and componentwise) does it matter what order you add? scale a vector by multiplying by a scalar (hence the name). do this algebraically and geometrically. subtract vectors say a bit about the “span” of vectors (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). What about the span of two other 3-vectors?
