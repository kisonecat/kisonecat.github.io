1

polar coordinates (16.4)

reminder about polar coordinates shape of “polar rectangle” area of “polar rectangle” example: ﬁnd the volume bounded by the plane z = 0 and the paraboloid z = 1 − x2 + y 2 example: ﬁnd the volume of a sphere.

2

applications? (16.5)

imagine an “applied literature” course, or an “applied art” course. average value center of mass

3

triple integrals (16.6)

deﬁnition “rectangles” in R3 . fubini still works example: integrate a polynomial over a box example: integrate the “1” function over the tetrahedron

4

cylindrical coordinates (16.7)

a combination of polar and cartesian coordinates x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ and z = z. draw a picture

volume of a cylinder ﬁnd the volume of the solid that lies within both the cylidner x2 + y 2 = 1 and the sphere x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4.
