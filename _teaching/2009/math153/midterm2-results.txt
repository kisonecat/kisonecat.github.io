Relationship between the midterms
The scores from the second exam do correlate with the scores from the ﬁrst exam; the normalized scores on the second midterm were about 70% those of the ﬁrst midterm. Here is a formula relating the second midterm scores to the ﬁrst midterm scores: Second Midterm = 0.682 · First Midterm + 47.8 For example, if I scored 210 on the ﬁrst midterm, I might have expected to score 191 on the second midterm.

Translation into letter grades
If the sum of your scores on the midterms exceeds 400, you are on track to get an A. Scoring above 350 points puts you on target for a B. If you are not doing as well as you want to be doing, you should talk to me so we can work together towards your success. I have weighted the ﬁnal exam heavily not because I want the ﬁnal exam to be terrifying, but because I want to give you every opportunity to pull your grade up.

An inspirational message
There can be some concern about how I will be assigning letter grades. I take the assignment of grades extremely seriously: the numbers I give out frankly don’t matter, but the letter grades I give out will be on your college transcript forever. I will do my best to be both merciful and just (as I hope I have demonstrated during the quarter). It was not so long ago that I received grades, and for all the eﬀort I put into my grades, they have proved to be unimportant. Recommendation letters, on the other hand, are extremely important, as is hard work. Hard work is most important of all. You may ﬁnd things are easy now, but there will come a time when mathematics will be hard (we humans are fortunate to be able to do any mathematics at all), and what distinguishes the merely talented from the truly great is not skill, but persistence.

The deﬁnition of mathematics is discipline
Looking up µαθ . . . in a Greek-English lexicon:

Indeed, mathematics epitomizes learning.
