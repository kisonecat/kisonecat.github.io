1. For each of the following sets, ﬁnd the least upper bound (if it exists) and the greatest lower bound (if it exists). (a) (3, 5).

(b) [−4, 17).

(c) [0, ∞).

(d) {x ∈ R : x < 6}.

(e) {x ∈ R : x2 < 2}.

(f ) {x ∈ R : |x − 1| < 3}.

2. Which of the sets in Problem 1 are bounded?

3. Suppose S is a bounded set of real numbers, and T is a subset of S. Is T also bounded? Why or why not?
