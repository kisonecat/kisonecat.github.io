A true statement about functions and their derivatives can be “translated” into a possibly true statement about sequences and their diﬀerences.

Notation
Sequences have bold names, e.g., a, b, c. The terms of a sequence are indexed by a subscript, e.g., an ; the index may be any integer, e.g., a−23 . Operators, which transform one sequence into another, are denoted by a capital letter. Some operators include: Diﬀerence (Da)n = an+1 − an Sum
n

Shift ai (Sa)n = an+1 .

(Σa)n =
i=0

The sum rule
The “derivative” of a sum is the sum of the “derivatives,” as follows: (D (a + b))n = = = = (a + b)n+1 − (a + b)n an+1 + bn+1 − an − bn (an+1 − an ) + (bn+1 − bn ) (Da)n + (Db)n .

Formally, this resembles (f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x).

Mathematics is not just about solving problems: it is about analogies (and analogies between analogies). If two things are perfectly analogous, they are exactly the same, so analogies are most interesting when they are imperfect. In this spirit, I present a “dictionary,” the term mathematicians often use when speaking of an analogy between two ﬁelds of study. In this case, the analogy is between functions and sequences, between calculus and “the calculus of ﬁnite diﬀerences.”

x

Formally, this resembles the fact that if f (x) = F (x), then
0

f (x) dx = F (x) − F (0).

The product rule
We can take successive diﬀerences of the product of two sequences as follows: D (a · b)n = = = = = (a · b)n+1 − (a · b)n an+1 · bn+1 − an · bn an+1 · bn+1 − an · bn+1 + an · bn+1 − an · bn (an+1 − an ) · bn+1 + an · (bn+1 − bn ) (Da)n · bn+1 + an · (Db)n .

Formally, this resembles (f · g) (x) = f (x) · g(x) + f (x) · g (x).

Exercises
Exercise 1. Let an = n. What is Da? Exercise 2. Let an = n · n. What is Da? Exercise 3. Find a sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation Da = 2. Exercise 4. Find a sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation D2 a = 2. Can you ﬁnd another sequence solving the equation (besides a + C)? Can you ﬁnd a third solution? Exercise 5. Find a nonzero sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation Da = a. Exercise 6. Find a nonzero sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation Da = c · a. Exercise 7. Find a nonzero sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation Da = c · a. Is this always possible? Exercise 8. Find a nonzero sequence a solving the diﬀerence equation D2 a = −a. This is quite interesting; a sequence which begins 2, 2, 0, −4, −8, −8, 0, 16, 32, 32, 0, −64, −128, −128, 0, 256, 512, . . . is a solution—but can you ﬁnd the general pattern?

Shift equations
Another equation you might enjoy solving is a “shift equation” (these are usually called recurrence relations): can you ﬁnd a sequence an which solves the equation Sa = 4 · a? The Fibonacci numbers fn are a solution to a shift equation: S 2 f = Sf + f .

Solving a shift equation
As a toy problem to consider, ﬁnd a sequence an which solves S 2 a = 5 · Sa − 6 · a by the following method. Rearrange this equation to have the form S 2 a − 5 · Sa + 6 · a = 0. “Factor” the operators to get (S − 3) (S − 2) a = 0. But (S − 2) kills the sequence an = 2n , and (S − 3) kills the sequence an = 3n . Is it the case that an = α · 2n + β · 3n is a solution to S 2 a = 5 · Sa − 6 · a, for any constants α and β? What happens if you use this same trick on the Fibonacci sequence?
