Lecture 24: Integrals with tricks
Math 153 Section 57 Friday November 21, 2008
Following chapter 8.3. There are many other tricks not in the book; we will cover some of these. Also, I will try to do examples that you might actually care about.

Products of sines and cosines
From your homework you know how to do sin(2x) cos(3x) dx by using parts. You can also do sin2 x dx by using a trig substitution. You can also do sinn x cosm x dx by making a substitution cos2 x + sin2 x = 1.

Repeated integration
uv = uv1 − u v2 + u v3 − · · · + (−1)n u(n) vn+1

Integrals of products of sines and cosines
Do sin(ax) cos(bx) dx by using an angle sum formula? No! Use parts twice. Powers of trig functions? Replace sin2 x with 1 − cos2 x as follows cos3 x sin5 x dx = cos x(1 − sin2 x) sin5 x dx = 1 (1 − u2 ) u5 du =

Trig identities
1 − sin2 x = cos2 x. 1 + tan2 x = sec2 x. sec2 x − a = tan2 x. √ So if you see a2 − x2 , set x = a sin u. For example, r√
0

r2 − x2 dx

which we know is πr2 /4. But let’s check it. Set x = r sin u and dx = r cos u du. Then the integral above is
π/2

r2 − r2 sin2 u r cos u du
0

But this becomes
0

π/2

r2 which becomes
0

1 − sin2 u cos u du
π/2

r2 cos2 u du which we can do using cos u = (1 + cos(2u))/2, so get
π/2 2

r2
0

1 + cos(2u) r2 du = 2 2

π/2

(1 + cos(2u)) du
0

which is πr2 /4, as we suspected.

Volume of a sphere
Even easier to compute the volume of a sphere this way! A hemisphere has volume
r 0

√ 2 π( r2 − x2 )2 dx = πr3 3

So the whole sphere has voluem 4πr3 /3.

Volume of a hypersphere
A hemi-hypersphere has volume
r 0

4 √ 2 π( r − x2 )3 dx 3

If we make a trig substitution x = r sin u and dx = r cos u we get 4r4 π V = 3
π/2

cos4 u du
0

This is an integral we can do! Replace cos2 u with (1 + cos(2u))/2, and get 4r4 π V = 3 or equivalently V = Now do it again! 4r4 π V = 12 I’ll clean it up a bit V = 4r4 π 24
π/2 π/2 π/2 0

1 + cos(2u) 2

2

du

4r4 π 12

π/2

1 + 2 cos(2u) + cos2 (2u) du
0

1 + 2 cos(2u) +
0

1 + cos(4u) 2

du

(3 + 4 cos(2u) + cos(4u)) du
0

But the integrals of cos(2u) and cos(4u) vanish (do not do more work than you need to do!). We end up with, 4r4 π r4 π 2 V = (3π/2) = 24 4 This is a volume for a hemisphere, so the whole sphere has volume V = r4 π 2 2 r4 π 2 = 4 2

Yeah, this seems a bit ad hoc but in a multivariable course, you’ll see a more conceptual route to these calculations. Is this right? B 2 sits inside a box built out of two B 1 ’s; so π < 2 · 2. In the same way, B 4 sits inside a box built out of two B 2 ’s, so π 2 /2 < π 2 . Not exactly a big surprise.

Using power series
∞

log(1 + e−x ) dx
0

This is
0

∞ ∞ n=1

(e−x )n (−1)n+1 dx n 3

which we can integrate term by term (why?!)
∞ 0 ∞

n=1

(e−nx )(−1)n+1 dx n

which gives

∞

n=1 2

(−1)n+1 n2

which is π /12. Why is that? Let A = even 1/n2 and B = odd 1/n2 . We want to compute B −A. But B +A = 4A, so B = 3A. And B + A = π 2 /6 = 4A, so A = π 2 /24 and B = π 2 /8. Then B − A = π 2 /12.
