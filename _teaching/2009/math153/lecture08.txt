Reminder about integrals

The importance of the fundamental theorem.

Logarithms
a

Deﬁne log a = 1 dx/x. What is lima→∞ log a? This is an improper integral. Incidentally, why is log a + log b = log(ab)? On the second integral in
a 1

dx + x

b 1

dx x

do a substitution: u = ax. Then dx = u/a and x = u/a, so dx/x = du/u. But
ab ab dx du dx + = x u x a 1 1 Hand out slide rules to demonstrate the power of this fact. a

Two bad things

Either unbounded width, or unbounded height. Both are “improper.”

4

Unbounded intervals
∞ b

When we write a we mean limb→∞ a . If the limit exists, the improper integral converges. If not, it “diverges.” ∞ ∞ ∞ Examples: 1 dx/x. 1 dx/x2 . 0 sin x dx. Diﬀerent reasons for why these integrals diverge. ∞ Remark: 1 dx/xp converges if p > 1, and diverges if 0 < p ≤ 1. 1

Unbounded on both sides
∞ −∞

When we write

we mean limb→∞
b . −b

∞ 0

+ limb→−∞

0 . b

This is not the same as limb→∞

Example: sin x.

Unbounded integrand
b a b

If f is continuous on [a, b) but not deﬁned at b, we can still integrate, by deﬁning f (x) dx = lim −
c→b

f (x) dx
a

Because for each number c < b, the integral over [a, c] ⊂ [a, b) makes sense. 2 Example: 0 dx/x.
