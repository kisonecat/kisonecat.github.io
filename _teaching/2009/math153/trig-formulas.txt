How to remember all trigonometric formulas
Required Background
You have to know about complex numbers (e.g., “a + bi” where i2 = −1) and about the rules for exponentiation.

Idea
For now, we will bravely deﬁne eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ. We’ll see in a couple weeks why this is a true statement (i.e., it corresponds with what we already meant by ex , sin x, and cos x). For now, we’ll just accept it—accepting also that it is very hard to understand what it should mean to raise a number to an imaginary power! Nevertheless, our brave deﬁnition gives an interpretation. We will ignore the conceptual concern, and simply manipulate the above equation to translate facts about exponentiation to imaginary powers into facts about trigonometric functions. We assume that all the usual rules for exponentiation apply.

Theory: A Famous Example
Some of you might have heard that eiπ + 1 = 0, an equation which relates ﬁve famous numbers: zero, one, e, π, and i. In other words, eiπ = −1, and we can see why by using the above equation: eiπ = cos π + i sin π = −1, because cos π = −1 and sin π = 0.

Practice: Double-angle formula
For instance, let’s say we want to have a formula for cos 2θ in terms of cos θ and sin θ. We use the fact that eiθ · eiθ = eiθ+iθ = ei(θ+θ) = ei(2θ) because exponents add. Substitute in our brave deﬁnition to get (cos θ + i sin θ)(cos θ + i sin θ) = cos(2θ) + i sin(2θ).

Neo: What are you trying to tell me? That I can memorize all trigonometric formulas? Morpheus: No, Neo. I’m trying to tell you that when you’re ready, you won’t have to.

But we can expand the left-hand side to ﬁnd cos2 θ − sin2 θ + 2i cos θ sin θ = cos(2θ) + i sin(2θ). Since real and imaginary parts must be equal, we then conclude cos2 θ − sin2 θ = cos(2θ), 2 cos θ sin θ = sin(2θ), giving us the double angle formulas.

Diﬀerence formula
You can use this method to get a formula for sin(a − b) in terms of sines and cosines of a and b. We have that eia · e−ib = ei(a−b) , and replacing the exponentials with trigonometric functions gives (cos a + i sin a)(cos(−b) + i sin(−b)) = cos(a − b) + i sin(a − b). Expanding the left-hand side gives cos a cos(−b) + i2 sin a sin(−b) + i sin a cos(−b) + i cos a sin(−b) = cos(a − b) + i sin(a − b). But i2 = −1, so (cos a cos(−b) − sin a sin(−b)) + i (sin a cos(−b) + cos a sin(−b)) = cos(a − b) + i sin(a − b). Again, real and imaginary parts must equal, so cos a cos(−b) − sin a sin(−b) = cos(a − b), sin a cos(−b) + cos a sin(−b) = sin(a − b). Since cos(−b) = cos b and sin(−b) = − sin b, we could also write these as cos a cos b + sin a sin b = cos(a − b), sin a cos b − cos a sin b = sin(a − b). The moral: memorizing identities is diﬃcult, and while rederiving them when needed might be just as complicated, it requires less rote memorization—and for some people, this is a huge help.
