Lecture 2: Sequences
Math 153 Section 57 Wednesday October 1, 2008
We will be following chapter 11.2. Here we introduce sequences (some “nouns”), deﬁne some properties (bounded above, bounded below, increasing, decreasing, non-decreasing, non-increasing; the “adjectives”), and prove that some sequences satisfy some of the properties. Remember: N is for the natural numbers, and R is for the real numbers.

Sequences

Intuitive deﬁnition: a list of numbers that goes on forever. Precise deﬁnition: a function a : N → R, but instead of writing a(n), we normally write it with subscripts, like a1 , a2 , . . .. Some terminology: the numbers in the sequence are “terms,” e.g., the ﬁrst term, second term, third term.

1.1

Building sequences

Deﬁne a sequence by giving a formula for the n-th term. Examples of sequences: an = n. bn = 2n. cn = 2n . dn = (−1)n . Modify sequences: fn = 17 · an . Combine sequences: gn = bn + cn , or hn = cn · dn . Then gn = n + 2n, and hn = (−2)n .

1.2

Why do we care?

Mathematically: A fun object to play with, sort of like numbers (we can add, subtract, multiply, divide). Practically: sequences come up all the time: an might be how much money I have on the n day of trading stocks (decreasing), the number of rabbits in a ﬁeld after n generations (unbounded, increasing), etc.

Boundedness

A sequence an is bounded above if there is a number b such that b ≥ an for all n ∈ N. A sequence an is bounded below if there is a number b such that b ≤ an for all n ∈ N. A sequence is bounded if it is bounded above, and bounded below. Examples: an = 17. an = 2n . an = −n. an = (−1)n . an = (−1)n · n.

1.4

Monotonicity

Increasing? Decreasing? Nonincreasing? Nondecreasing? Increasing means for all n ∈ N that an < an+1 . Decreasing means for all n ∈ N that an > an+1 . Non-increasing means for all n ∈ N that an ≥ an+1 . Non-decreasing means for all n ∈ N that an ≤ an+1 . Examples of increasing sequences: an = 2n, an = n2 . Proofs. Example of a decreasing sequence: an = 1/n. Example of a decreasing sequence: an = 1/n2 . Proofs. Examples of non-increasing sequences: an = 17. Examples of non-decreasing sequences: an = (n + 1)/2 if n is odd, n/2 if n is even,

Another example: an = (−1)n + n.

1.5

Some remarks

To prove something is increasing, you must check inﬁnitely many things. To prove something is not increasing, you need a single counterexample. “Not increasing is not the same thing as non-increasing.”

1.6

Some basic theorems.

The sum of two bounded sequences is bounded. The sum of two unbounded sequences is unbounded?
