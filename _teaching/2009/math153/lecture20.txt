Diﬀerentiating term-by-term

Deﬁne f : (−r, r) → R by f (x) = ∞ an xn . n=0 If ∞ an xn converges on (−r, r), then n=0

the term-wise derivative, also converges on (−r, r). Moreover, f is diﬀerentiable on (−r, r), and
∞

f (x) =
n=0

d (an xn ) = dx

an · n · xn−1
n=1

Consequently: if you plug a power series into the machine that ﬁnds a Taylor series expansion, you get out the original power series. This is a key point, because if we can produce a power series by some other method, then we have found a Taylor series.

Radius of convergence, not same interval
xn /n2 converges on [−1, 1], but the dreivative only converges on [−1, 1).

Integrating term-by-term

Deﬁne f : (−r, r) → R by a series f (x) =
n=0

an xn

which converges for x ∈ (−r, r) Deﬁne F (x) =

n=0

an xn n+1

which also converges for x ∈ (−r, r), and f (x) dx = F (x) + C Remember the C.

Logs
∞ n n n=0 (−1) x ,

Since 1/(1 + x) =

we have that

log(1 + x) =

(−1)n xn+1 +C n+1

But C = 0.

Endpoints

Abel’s theorem: if ∞ an xn converges on (−r, r), and f (x) equals the series there. n=0 If f is left continuous at r and the series converges, then f (r) = ∞ an rn . n=0 If f is right continuous at −r and the series converges, then f (r) = ∞ an (−r)n . n=0 So endpoints do get ﬁlled in correctly by series.

Not a correct argument whatsoever
sin x = (1 − x/π) (1 + x/π) 1 − x 2π x2 4π 2 1+ x ··· 2π

Multiply pairs of positive and negative roots, to get sin x = x 1− x2 π2 2 1− ···

Multiply it out? 1− 1 1 1 + 2+ + ··· 2 π 4π 16π 2
sin x . x

x2 + · · · So, maybe

But this should be the same as the Taylor series for

1 1 = 2 π 3!

So maybe ∞ 1/n2 = 1/6. n=1 Well, no. We don’t have any justiﬁcation for making these arguments—why should that inﬁnite product be equal to (sin x)/x?
