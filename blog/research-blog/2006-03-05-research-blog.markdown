I've been thinking for a while that I ought to start a research blog--something just to keep myself organized about the things I am thinking about, my thoughts on the papers I've read, my ideas, my questions. I figure I might as well make it public, though I seriously doubt anyone is going to read this.

Anyway, hence this blog. We'll see how it works.
