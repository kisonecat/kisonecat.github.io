It's great to read the comments and find out what users wish were different: a lot of people don't just want to *Unclose Window* but also *Unclose Tab*.

For me, I really would have liked to have *Unclose Window* be underneath the Edit menu, but because the undo hierarchy is linked to the window (i.e., when you switch windows, the possible things you can undo changes) it isn't possible to undo the very destruction of the window itself.

The whole idea of "undoing" something is very amusing, especially the modern sense; the old sense of "undoing" something by destroying it is quite dissimilar from the idea of restoring to a previous state.
