Here is a question that I haven't been able to find very much about:

> What are the finite subgroups of the rotation groups $SO(n)$?

For examples, I can take a Coxeter group, and choose elements corresponding to rotations (e.g., the subgroup generated by products of generators), but that's not going to produce very many examples.
