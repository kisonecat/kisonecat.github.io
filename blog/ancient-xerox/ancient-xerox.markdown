  The Romans (among others!) wrote in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_tablet">wax with a stylus</a>; the wax was embedded in boards, which were bound together in pairs.  <b>If a Roman were to place clay between these boards, could they make a copy of their wax tablet in the clay?</b>

It strikes me as remarkable that coins were minted so long before books were printed&mdash;though I guess the motivation behind minting coins and printing books are rather different.
