Specifically, the conjecture is that where $J_N$ computes the colored Jones polynomial and $\xi_N = e^{2\pi i / N}$. For some knots $K$, there are nice formulas for $J_N(K;\xi_N)$. For instance, if $K$ is the figure eight knot, then $J_N(K;q)$ can be written as When $q = \xi_N$ and one takes the limit, this sum transforms quite nicely...</div>

This should measure how difficult it is to "relate" $x$ and $y$.The ends of the metric space $(\Sigma^\star, d_T)$ should correspond to infinite random bitstrings, and because choosing a different...</div>
