There are some questions about outer space that I would like to be able to answer.  Some nice survey articles look to be @MR1957048 and also @MR1950871.

Here is a ridiculously simple question I have wondered about: given $A, B \subset F_n$, say with $[F_n : A] = [F_n : B]$, how can I tell if $A$ and $B$ are conjugate?  I suspect I'm being stupid here.

In light of my recent comments on LINCOS and communicating with extraterristrials, I found the article @MR1754781.

[Putnam](http://www.math.harvard.edu/preceptor/seminar/2001/index02.html) also makes use of the idea of mathematicians from other planets, to more philosophical ends.
