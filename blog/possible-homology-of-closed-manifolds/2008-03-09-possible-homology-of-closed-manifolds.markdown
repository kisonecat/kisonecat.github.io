In this fun paper @MR1845679 it is pointed out that

- *homology* is a very basic invariant, and
- *closed manifolds* are very basic objects

and so a very basic question is: what sequences of abelian groups are
the homology groups of a closed simply connected manifold?

It isn't very hard to realize any sequence of abelian groups *up to
the middle dimension,* but that middle dimension is tricky (e.g.,
classify $(n-1)$-connected $2n$-manifolds).

Anyway, I was wondering: is this realization question solvable for homology with coefficients in $\Z/2\Z$ or $\Q$?
