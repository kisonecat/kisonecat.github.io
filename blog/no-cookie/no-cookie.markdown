  Today, I was about to sit down and read a paper (in French--I may not speak in tongues, but apparently I can read in tongues, so to speak!), and I thought to myself about <strong>how nice it would be to have a cookie.</strong>  I went to Uncle Joe's, I went to the Classics Cafe, I went to Cobb's coffee shop, and then I gave up, for there were <strong>no cookies in any of those places</strong>, places which so often appear to be the source of cookies.

Is there someplace else on campus that I should have looked?  Admittedly, I probably would've settled for the biscotti in the divinity school cafe (especially with some coffee).
